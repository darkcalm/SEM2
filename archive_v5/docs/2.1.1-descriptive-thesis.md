Research methodologies are not ethically neutral tools; they are frameworks that shape what can be known and how it can be known, and in doing so, they bring distinct ethical dimensions into focus. This paper provides a descriptive analysis of this relationship, mapping how different families of research methods—from quantitative and economic to qualitative and participatory—are intrinsically linked to different ethical considerations, such as principles of distributive, procedural, and recognition justice. By examining the interplay between the formal rules of procedural ethics and the situational challenges of ethics in practice, this paper aims to describe the complex terrain researchers must navigate, rather than to advocate for any single methodological approach.
