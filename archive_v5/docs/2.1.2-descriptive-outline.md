### Paper Outline: A Descriptive Map of Methodology and Ethics

**Title:** The Ethical Dimensions of Method: A Descriptive Analysis of Research Practice

**1. Introduction**
    -   **Hook:** Start with a simple statement about the dual responsibility of research: to produce reliable knowledge and to do so ethically.
    -   **Thesis Statement:** Present the descriptive thesis, establishing the paper's goal to map, not critique, the relationship between methods and ethics.
    -   **Roadmap:** Briefly outline the paper's structure: introduce the concept of "procedural ethics" vs. "ethics in practice," then systematically explore four major families of research methods and their corresponding ethical considerations.

**2. Framing the Landscape: Procedural Ethics and Ethics in Practice**
    -   **Concept:** Introduce and define the distinction from the EC (2018) guidance.
        -   *Procedural Ethics:* The world of IRBs, consent forms, regulations.
        -   *Ethics in Practice:* The everyday, contextual ethical choices researchers make.
    -   **Purpose:** Explain that this framework allows for a descriptive, non-judgmental analysis of the tensions and interactions between formal rules and practical realities.

**3. A Descriptive Tour of Methodological Families**
    -   **(Section for each family of methods):**
    -   **3.1. Quantitative and Economic Methods**
        -   *Description:* What they are (e.g., CBA) and what they aim to do (standardize, quantify).
        -   *Ethical Landscape:* Primarily addresses distributive justice. Note the ethical imperative of methodological rigor (Wieten, 2017) â€“ bad science is unethical. Discuss how it can sideline recognition justice.
    -   **3.2. Qualitative and Ethnographic Methods**
        -   *Description:* What they are (e.g., interviews, observation, BOAP) and what they aim to do (understand context, meaning).
        -   *Ethical Landscape:* Well-suited for exploring recognition and procedural justice. Describe the primary risks as social/psychological and the importance of confidentiality (EC, 2018).
    -   **3.3. Participatory Methods**
        -   *Description:* What they are (e.g., PAR) and what they aim to do (co-produce knowledge).
        -   *Ethical Landscape:* The embodiment of procedural justice. The ethical challenges shift from protection to collaboration and shared ownership.
    -   **3.4. Internet-Mediated Research**
        -   *Description:* What it is (e.g., social media analysis) and its unique characteristics.
        -   *Ethical Landscape:* Focus on the tension between public data and private lives, the challenges of informed consent, and the "mosaic effect" (EC, 2018).

**4. The Figure of the Methodologist**
    -   **Concept:** Introduce Nelson's (2020) concept of the "methodologist" as a specific actor in science.
    -   **Purpose:** Use this concept to describe *how* methodological and ethical norms evolve. Show that the landscape is not static but is constantly being shaped by these actors who debate and refine the tools of research.

**5. Conclusion**
    -   **Synthesis:** Briefly summarize the descriptive map, reiterating that each methodological choice opens up a different ethical terrain.
    -   **Final Thought:** Conclude not with a judgment, but with the observation that ethical research requires a constant, reflexive engagement with the chosen methods and their inherent ethical dimensions. It is an ongoing practice, not a checklist to be completed.
