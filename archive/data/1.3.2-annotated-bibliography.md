### Annotated Bibliography

1.  **Alonso Pedrero, R., & Van de Sande Araujo, F. (2025). Open science in energy research. *Open Research Europe*.**
    *   **Annotation:** This article provides a foundational argument for the importance of open science within the energy research sector. It highlights how current practices, such as keeping data secret and using proprietary code, create ethical concerns and hinder knowledge sharing. The paper directly supports the core thesis that open science can lead to more transparent, replicable, and ultimately more ethical research outcomes in the energy field. It will be a cornerstone for defining the problem and solution in the reflection paper.

2.  **Fell, M. J., Watson, N. E., & Huebner, G. (2024). Open science and the climate crisis. *PLOS Climate*.**
    *   **Annotation:** This opinion piece connects open science directly to the urgency of the climate crisis, arguing that transparency is key to generating robust and trustworthy research. It points out the energy research field's slow adoption of open science practices like data sharing and preregistration. This source strengthens the argument by linking open science not just to good research practice, but to the larger societal goal of effectively addressing climate change, adding a layer of urgency and impact.

3.  **Rana, S., et al. (2023). Geographical Dependence of Open Hardware Optimization: Case Study of Solar Photovoltaic Racking. *Technologies*.**
    *   **Annotation:** This case study is a perfect practical example of open-source appropriate technology (OSAT) in action. It demonstrates how open-source hardware can reduce costs for renewable energy technology (solar PV racking) but emphasizes that the "best" design is geographically dependent on local material costs and availability. This provides concrete evidence for how open, flexible designs are more ethical and sustainable, as they can be adapted to local contexts, empowering communities rather than imposing a one-size-fits-all solution.

4.  **Mottaghi, M., et al. (2023). AC/off-grid photovoltaic powered open-source ball mill. *HardwareX*.**
    *   **Annotation:** This paper details the creation of a low-cost, open-source scientific instrument that can be powered by solar energy. It serves as another powerful case study showing how open-source hardware makes essential technology more accessible, particularly in off-grid or developing regions. It supports the argument that open science is not just about data and software, but also about the physical tools of research, and that making these tools open and sustainable is an ethical imperative.

5.  **Miller, C. (2014). Ethics of Energy Transitions. *Online Ethics Center for Engineering and Science*.**
    *   **Annotation:** Miller's report provides a robust framework for understanding the ethical dimensions of large-scale energy transitions. It moves beyond simple cost-benefit analysis to include crucial concepts of distributive justice (who wins and loses) and procedural justice (who decides). This article will be instrumental in structuring the ethical arguments of the paper, providing the vocabulary and concepts needed to critique current energy policy and advocate for more just, participatory, and open approaches.

6.  **Bethem, J., et al. (2020). Energy decisions within an applied ethics framework: an analysis of five recent controversies. *Energy, Sustainability and Society*.**
    *   **Annotation:** This paper offers a practical, applied ethics framework for evaluating complex energy decisions. Its analysis of the Dakota Access Pipeline using a Lakota Sioux ethical perspective is particularly relevant, as it demonstrates how to incorporate non-Western and community-specific values into energy policy debates. This provides a methodological example for the reflection paper, showing how to weigh different ethical principles and argue for a more just and sustainable decision-making process in the energy sector.
