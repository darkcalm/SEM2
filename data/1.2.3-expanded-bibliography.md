### Expanded Annotated Bibliography: Methodology & Ethics

*   **European Commission. (2018). *Ethics in Social Science and Humanities*.**
    *   **Annotation:** This comprehensive guidance document provides the foundational framework for the paper's descriptive analysis. It distinguishes between "procedural ethics" (compliance) and "ethics in practice" (everyday ethical decision-making), a key distinction for mapping the field. It details the ethical dimensions of specific, often controversial, methods like deception and covert research, providing criteria for their justified use. Crucially, it defines risk in SSH research not just as physical harm, but as potential social, emotional, and reputational damage. It also provides detailed checklists for informed consent and risk assessment, making it a practical guide for analyzing the ethical landscape of different methodologies.

*   **Hyysalo, S., Pollock, N., & Williams, R. A. (2019). "Method Matters in the Social Study of Technology: Investigating the Biographies of Artifacts and Practices". *Science & Technology Studies*.**
    *   **Annotation:** This paper offers a specific methodological framework, the "biography of artifacts and practices" (BOAP), as an alternative to traditional "snap-shot" case studies. The BOAP approach involves longitudinal and multi-site research to trace how technologies evolve. From a descriptive standpoint, this paper is valuable because it exemplifies a concrete methodological choice designed to capture a more complete and nuanced picture of technological development, thereby carrying its own set of ethical implications regarding long-term engagement with research subjects and settings.

*   **Nelson, N. C. (2020). "The Methodologists: a Unique Category of Scientific Actors". *Engaging Science, Technology, and Society*.**
    *   **Annotation:** This essay introduces a useful analytical category: the "methodologist." These are scientific actors who focus on questioning, refining, and challenging methods that their peers may take for granted. This concept allows for a descriptive analysis of *how* methodological debates happen within science. Instead of a monolithic "science" using "methods," we can describe a more dynamic process where specific actors (methodologists) play a key role in the evolution of research practices. This helps frame the discussion in a descriptive rather than a critical way.

*   **Wieten, S. (2017). "Not Just About Consent: The Ethical Dimensions of Research Methodology Knowledge in IRBs". *BMJ Medical Ethics Blog*.**
    *   **Annotation:** This post makes a direct and powerful connection between methodological quality and ethics. It argues that methodologically unsound research is inherently unethical because it exposes participants to risk for no potential benefit and wastes resources. This provides a clear, defensible principle for the analysis: one of the core ethical dimensions of any methodology is its capacity to produce reliable knowledge. This source allows for an analysis of methodological rigor as an ethical imperative.

*   **Cambridge Journal of Human Behaviour. (n.d.). "Code of Ethics".**
    *   **Annotation:** This document serves as a practical example of how general ethical principles are translated into specific, actionable guidelines for an interdisciplinary journal. It synthesizes rules from various fields (anthropology, psychology, natural sciences), showing how different disciplines approach similar ethical problems. It provides detailed guidance on handling "Protected Characteristics" (race, gender, etc.) and specific instructions for animal research, use of images, and data sharing. This makes it an excellent source for describing the practical application of ethical principles in diverse research contexts.
