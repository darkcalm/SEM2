### V7 Final Synthesis: Methodology, Justice, and Open Science in Energy Research

This document provides the final, integrated synthesis for the paper. It connects the project's three core pillars: (1) research methodologies, (2) their inherent ethical dimensions, framed by energy justice, and (3) the role of open science in addressing the ethical challenges that arise.

#### 1. The Central Argument: A Three-Pillar Framework

The core argument is that **methodological choices are ethical choices, and open science provides practical tools to make more ethical choices.** To analyze this, we use a three-part framework:
-   **Methodology:** The tool used for inquiry (e.g., CBA, ethnography, PAR).
-   **Ethical Terrain (Energy Justice):** The specific justice dimensions the method brings to the forefront (distributive, procedural, recognition).
-   **Open Science Solution:** Specific, practical open-source practices that can mitigate the ethical risks of a given methodology.

#### 2. Mapping the Framework with Energy Case Studies

##### a. Quantitative Methods (CBA) -> Distributive Justice -> Open Data

-   **Method & Ethics:** As established in V6, quantitative methods like Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) are primarily concerned with **distributive justice**. However, their use in large energy projects, like the La Guajira transmission line, shows how their aggregated, economic focus can obscure issues of **recognition justice** by failing to value non-monetary, cultural, or ancestral assets (Vega-Araújo & Heffron, 2022).
-   **Open Science Solution:** The key ethical risk of CBAs—their "black box" nature—can be mitigated by **open data**. By making the underlying data, models, and assumptions of a CBA publicly available, open science allows for greater transparency and contestability. Stakeholders, including affected communities, can scrutinize the inputs, challenge the valuations, and propose alternative models. This practice does not eliminate the inherent limitations of CBA, but it transforms it from an opaque, top-down decree into a more transparent and debatable tool, thereby enhancing **procedural justice**.

##### b. Qualitative Methods (Ethnography) -> Recognition Justice -> Open Access & Data Management

-   **Method & Ethics:** Qualitative methods excel at revealing issues of **recognition justice**, as seen in the La Guajira case, where interviews uncovered the crucial conflict between state-recognized and community-recognized leaders (Vega-Araújo & Heffron, 2022). However, these methods carry their own ethical risks, primarily concerning the privacy and representation of vulnerable participants.
-   **Open Science Solution:** **Open access publishing** and **FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data principles** offer a path forward. Open access ensures that the research findings—which often give voice to marginalized communities—are not locked behind paywalls, making them accessible to the communities themselves and to a wider audience. Simultaneously, robust data management plans, informed by FAIR principles, provide a framework for sharing data ethically, ensuring that sensitive information is properly anonymized and that communities retain control over their own narratives.

##### c. Participatory Methods (PAR) -> Procedural Justice -> Open-Source Hardware

-   **Method & Ethics:** Participatory Action Research (PAR) is explicitly designed to embody **procedural justice**. However, it often faces a practical challenge: a lack of accessible tools that allow communities to be genuine co-producers of knowledge and technology, not just consultants. This was a driver of opposition in Australian wind farm projects, where engagement felt superficial (Gross, 2007).
-   **Open Science Solution:** **Open Source Appropriate Technology (OSAT)** provides a powerful solution. OSAT, such as open-source designs for solar panels or water pumps, provides communities with adaptable, low-cost tools that they can modify, maintain, and own (Pearce, 2019; Rana et al., 2023). This transforms participation from a consultative exercise into a process of genuine co-production and empowerment. By providing open-source tools, researchers can facilitate a more profound form of **procedural justice** where communities become true partners in shaping their own technological and energy futures.
