### Synthesis of Past Efforts and Mandate for Version 7

This document summarizes the key findings from a review of all previous project versions (`archive/` through `archive_v6/`) and establishes the guiding mandate for Version 7.

#### 1. Evolution of the Core Argument

-   **V1-V4:** The project began with a normative, argumentative stance, framing the ethical issues in energy research as a "problem" to be solved by a "solution" (initially, open science).
-   **V5:** A major shift occurred towards a more effective **descriptive framework**, mapping methodological families to ethical terrains (distributive, procedural, recognition justice). This met a core requirement of the PRD but lacked specificity.
-   **V6:** This version successfully addressed the lack of specificity by grounding the descriptive framework in a concrete **energy sector case study** (the La Guajira transmission line project). This provided the necessary context and analytical depth.

#### 2. The Missing Pillar: Open Science

A final review against the original course instructions revealed a critical omission in all prior versions: the role of **open science**. While V1-V4 mentioned it, they did so within a flawed argumentative structure. V5 and V6, while methodologically sounder, dropped this component entirely. The instructions explicitly require an analysis of "how open science can aid good research practice" in the context of energy research ethics.

#### 3. Guiding Mandate for Version 7

Based on this complete review, the mandate for Version 7 is to produce the final, definitive synthesis by integrating all successful components from prior versions:

**To apply the descriptive, case-grounded framework of Version 6 to the three-part relationship between (1) Research Methodology, (2) Ethical Dimensions, and (3) concrete Open Science practices that can address the ethical challenges identified.**

This requires a final pass through the literature to specifically pull out sources on open science (e.g., open data, open-source hardware) and connect them to the justice dimensions of the methodologies already analyzed. The final paper must not only map the ethical terrain but also describe the practical, open tools available to navigate it responsibly.
