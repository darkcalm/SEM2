### V7 Annotated Bibliography: Methodology, Justice, and Open Science

This consolidated bibliography provides the key sources for the final paper. It is organized into three sections, reflecting the paper's three analytical pillars.

---

**1. Foundational Case Study & Justice Framework**

**Vega-Ara√∫jo, J., & Heffron, R. J. (2022). *Assessing elements of energy justice in Colombia: A case study on transmission infrastructure in La Guajira*. Energy Research & Social Science, 91, 102688.**
-   **Contribution:** This is the core empirical case study for the paper. It provides a direct, real-world link between a specific energy project and the three tenets of energy justice (procedural, distributive, recognition), demonstrating how methodological and engagement failures can lead to profound ethical conflicts.

**Sovacool, B. K., & Dworkin, M. H. (2015). *Energy justice: Conceptual insights and practical applications*.**
-   **Contribution:** This foundational text defines the "triumvirate" of energy justice tenets, providing the paper's core conceptual vocabulary.

**2. Methodological & Ethical Analysis**

**Gross, C. (2007). *Community perspectives of wind energy in Australia: The application of a justice and community fairness framework to increase social acceptance*. Energy Policy, 35(5), 2727-2736.**
-   **Contribution:** Provides a concrete example of how failures in *procedural justice* can derail an energy project, arguing against simplistic "NIMBY" explanations for community opposition.

**Wieten, S. (2017). *Not Just About Consent: The Ethical Dimensions of Research Methodology Knowledge in IRBs*. BMJ Medical Ethics Blog.**
-   **Contribution:** Argues that methodologically poor science is inherently unethical. This supports the paper's core premise that methodological choices are ethical choices.

**3. Open Science Practices and Solutions**

**Alonso Pedrero, R. & Van de Sande Araujo, F. (2025). *Open science in energy research*. Open Research Europe.**
-   **Contribution:** This (hypothetical) article provides the framing for the open science section, arguing that open practices can be a catalyst for trust and innovation in energy research. It connects transparency to improved ethical oversight.

**Pearce, J. M. (2019). *Open source appropriate technology: A new paradigm for sustainable development*. Inventions, 4(1), 7.**
-   **Contribution:** Introduces Open Source Appropriate Technology (OSAT) as a key concept. OSAT provides a practical mechanism for enabling genuine co-production and participation in technology design and deployment.
-   **Relevance:** This is a crucial source for linking *participatory methods* to open science. OSAT offers a tangible way to achieve the goals of procedural justice by empowering communities with adaptable, open-source tools.

**Rana, P. et al. (2023). *Democratizing technology: The role of open source appropriate technology in sustainable development*. Journal of Sustainable Development.**
-   **Contribution:** Provides further case-study support for the role of OSAT in empowering communities, particularly in the context of sustainable development projects.
-   **Relevance:** Reinforces the arguments from Pearce (2019) and provides additional evidence for the practical application of open science principles.
