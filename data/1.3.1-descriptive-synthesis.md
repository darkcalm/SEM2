### A Descriptive Synthesis of Research Methodologies and Their Ethical Dimensions

This document provides a descriptive map of the relationship between research methodologies and their attendant ethical dimensions, drawing from the comprehensive synthesis and the expanded literature review.

**1. The Two Faces of Research Ethics**

A foundational concept for this analysis is the distinction between **procedural ethics** and **ethics in practice** (EC, 2018).
-   **Procedural Ethics:** Refers to the formal systems of compliance, such as institutional review boards (IRBs), consent forms, and data protection regulations. These are the formal rules of the road.
-   **Ethics in Practice:** Refers to the everyday, often informal, ethical decisions and "ethically important moments" that researchers face during their work.
This distinction allows for a more nuanced description, moving beyond a simple "good/bad" binary to an analysis of how formal rules interact with the messy reality of research.

**2. A Map of Methodological Families and Their Ethical Terrains**

Different families of methods are not ethically neutral; they are designed to see the world in particular ways, and in doing so, they bring specific ethical considerations to the forefront.

-   **Quantitative & Economic Methods (e.g., Cost-Benefit Analysis):**
    -   *Description:* These methods seek to produce objective, often numerical, representations of phenomena to allow for standardized comparison.
    -   *Ethical Dimensions:* Their primary ethical orientation is towards **distributive justice**â€”quantifying and allocating costs and benefits. A key ethical consideration, however, is that methodologically poor science is itself unethical (Wieten, 2017). A flawed CBA that exposes participants to risk for no reliable knowledge is an ethical failure. These methods can also obscure questions of **recognition justice** by aggregating diverse values into a single metric.

-   **Qualitative & Ethnographic Methods (e.g., Interviews, Observation):**
    -   *Description:* These methods seek to understand phenomena from the perspective of the actors involved, focusing on meaning, context, and lived experience. The "biography of artifacts and practices" (BOAP) framework is an example of a sophisticated qualitative method for longitudinal study (Hyysalo et al., 2019).
    -   *Ethical Dimensions:* These methods are well-suited to exploring **recognition justice** (respecting diverse values) and **procedural justice** (understanding perceptions of fairness). The primary ethical risks are often social and psychological rather than physical, such as breaches of privacy, confidentiality, and the potential for stigmatization (EC, 2018). The management of sensitive data and the protection of participant anonymity are paramount.

-   **Participatory Methods (e.g., Participatory Action Research):**
    -   *Description:* These methods actively involve research subjects as co-producers of knowledge, breaking down the traditional researcher/subject hierarchy.
    -   *Ethical Dimensions:* These methods are explicitly designed to embody **procedural justice**. The core ethical challenge shifts from "protecting" subjects to navigating the complexities of collaboration, shared ownership of data, and equitable distribution of benefits from the research.

-   **Internet-Mediated Research (e.g., Social Media Analysis):**
    -   *Description:* These methods use the internet as a site and tool for research, analyzing publicly available data or interacting with online communities.
    -   *Ethical Dimensions:* This area highlights the tension between "publicly available" and "ethically usable." Key ethical questions involve the user's reasonable expectation of privacy, the difficulty of obtaining meaningful informed consent, and the "mosaic effect," where combining anonymized datasets can inadvertently re-identify individuals (EC, 2018).

**3. The Role of "The Methodologist"**

The evolution and refinement of these methods are not automatic. They are driven by specific scientific actors that can be described as **"methodologists"** (Nelson, 2020). These are individuals or groups who focus on questioning, testing, and improving the tools of their trade. Describing the work of these actors (e.g., those who develop new statistical tests, or those who refine ethical guidelines for IRBs) is key to understanding how the ethical landscape of research changes over time. Their work reveals that methods are not static but are themselves objects of ongoing scientific inquiry and debate.
