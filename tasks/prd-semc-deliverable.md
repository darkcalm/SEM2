# PRD: SEMC Course Deliverable - Integrating Methodology, Ethics, and Open Science

## 1. Introduction/Overview

This document outlines requirements for a two-page reflection paper that integrates three core themes: the ethical failings of current energy research, the methodological choices that perpetuate these failings, and the role of open science in fostering more ethical methodologies and outcomes. The paper will synthesize findings from three prior attempts.

## 2. Goals

- **Primary Goal:** To produce a concise, compelling, and fully integrated reflection paper of approximately two pages (excluding references).
- **Core Argument:** To argue that the ethical and sustainability failures in energy research are not just matters of policy or outcome, but are deeply rooted in **methodological choices**. The paper must **weigh different research methodologies** (e.g., quantitative vs. qualitative, participatory vs. top-down) and demonstrate how open science provides a framework and toolset for adopting more just and effective methods.
- **Methodological Focus:** This is a primary, not secondary, goal. The paper must explicitly discuss and weigh research methods.

## 3. User Stories

- As a student, I want to synthesize the analyses from three previous attempts to build a foundational understanding of the problem and the open science solution.
- As a student, I want to **conduct a targeted literature search focused specifically on research methodologies** used to evaluate social and ethical dimensions of energy projects.
- As a student, I want to construct an argument that **explicitly weighs these methodology choices**, connecting top-down, quantitative-heavy methods to the "instrumental" paradigm, and participatory, qualitative methods to a more just, open science paradigm.
- As a student, I want to write a two-page paper that seamlessly integrates the critique, the methodological analysis, and the open science solution.

## 4. Functional Requirements

1.  **Synthesize Past Efforts:** The analyses from `archive/`, `archive_v2/`, and `archive_v3/` must be reviewed and synthesized.
2.  **Targeted Methodological Research:** A new semantic literature search must be performed to find papers that compare and critique research methodologies in the context of energy justice and sustainability.
3.  **Weigh Methodologies:** The paper must explicitly compare and contrast different research methodologies (e.g., cost-benefit analysis vs. ethnographic studies, contingent valuation vs. participatory action research) and link these choices to ethical outcomes.
4.  **Integrated Argument:** The argument must demonstrate a clear causal chain: flawed methodologies lead to ethical failures, and open science enables better methodologies that lead to more just outcomes.
5.  **Final Deliverable:** The final output will be a tex-based PDF with a complete reference list.

## 5. Success Metrics

- The final paper explicitly names, compares, and weighs different research methodologies.
- The argument successfully links methodological choices to ethical and sustainability outcomes.
- The paper seamlessly integrates the new methodological analysis with the established arguments about instrumentalism and open science from previous attempts.
