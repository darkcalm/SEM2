# PRD: SEMC Course Deliverable - A Descriptive Analysis of Methodology and Ethics in Energy Research

## 1. Introduction/Overview

This document outlines the requirements for a two-page reflection paper for the SEMC course. The paper must present a **descriptive and analytical overview** of the relationship between research methodologies and ethical dimensions in the context of energy research. The tone must be scholarly and observational, not opinionated or accusatory. The paper will synthesize findings from four prior attempts and new, broader research.

## 2. Goals

- **Primary Goal:** To produce a concise, well-sourced, and descriptive reflection paper of approximately two pages (excluding references).
- **Core Task:** To **describe and map** the landscape of research methodologies used in energy research and to analyze their corresponding ethical dimensions (e.g., how different methods engage with principles of procedural, distributive, and recognition justice). The paper should explore this relationship, not pass judgment on it.
- **Tone:** The writing must be simple, clear, and academic. It should describe "what is" rather than arguing for "what ought to be." The aim is analysis, not advocacy.

## 3. User Stories

- As a student, I want to synthesize the findings from four previous attempts to build a comprehensive map of concepts.
- As a student, I want to **conduct a broad literature search** to gather a wide range of sources on research methodologies in energy, sustainability, and science and technology studies.
- As a student, I want to construct an argument that **descriptively links** specific research methodologies (e.g., CBA, PAR, ethnographic studies) to specific ethical dimensions they bring into focus or exclude.
- As a student, I want to write a two-page paper in simple, clear language that presents this descriptive analysis.

## 4. Functional Requirements

1.  **Synthesize Past Efforts:** The analyses from `archive/`, `archive_v2/`, `archive_v3/`, and `archive_v4/` must be reviewed and synthesized.
2.  **Broad Literature Review:** A new, broad literature search must be performed to gather more sources and perspectives.
3.  **Descriptive Analysis:** The paper must describe how different methodologies function and what ethical considerations they entail, without adopting an overly critical or opinionated tone.
4.  **Final Deliverable:** The final output will be a tex-based PDF.
    -   **Formatting (Quotes):** Use `` and '' for double-quotes, and ` and ' for single quotes.
    -   **Formatting (Title):** The title-author-date block must be compact and use minimal vertical space.

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- The paper will not "pin failures on current practice" or adopt a polemical tone.
- The paper will not advocate for one methodology over another, but will instead analyze the characteristics of each.

## 6. Success Metrics

- The final paper is primarily descriptive and analytical in tone.
- The paper is well-supported by a broad range of scholarly sources.
- The writing style is simple and clear.
- The final PDF adheres to all specified formatting requirements.
