# PRD: SEMC Course Deliverable - A Descriptive Analysis of Methodology and Ethics in Energy Research

## 1. Introduction/Overview

This document outlines the requirements for a two-page reflection paper for the SEMC course. The paper must present a **descriptive and analytical overview** of the relationship between research methodologies and ethical dimensions in the context of energy research. The tone must be scholarly and observational, not opinionated or accusatory. The paper will synthesize findings from four prior attempts and new, broader research.

## 2. Goals

- **Primary Goal:** To produce a concise, well-sourced, and descriptive reflection paper of approximately two pages (excluding references).
- **Core Task:** To **describe and map** the landscape of research methodologies used in energy research and to analyze their corresponding ethical dimensions (e.g., how different methods engage with principles of procedural, distributive, and recognition justice). The paper should explore this relationship, not pass judgment on it.
- **Tone:** The writing must be simple, clear, and academic. It should describe "what is" rather than arguing for "what ought to be." The aim is analysis, not advocacy.

## 3. User Stories

- As a student, I want to synthesize the findings from four previous attempts to build a comprehensive map of concepts.
- As a student, I want to **conduct a broad literature search** to gather a wide range of sources on research methodologies in energy, sustainability, and science and technology studies.
- As a student, I want to construct an argument that **descriptively links** specific research methodologies (e.g., CBA, PAR, ethnographic studies) to specific ethical dimensions they bring into focus or exclude.
- As a student, I want to write a two-page paper in simple, clear language that presents this descriptive analysis.

## 4. Functional Requirements

1.  **Synthesize Past Efforts:** The analyses from `archive/`, `archive_v2/`, `archive_v3/`, and `archive_v4/` must be reviewed and synthesized.
2.  **Broad Literature Review:** A new, broad literature search must be performed to gather more sources and perspectives.
3.  **Descriptive Analysis:** The paper must describe how different methodologies function and what ethical considerations they entail, without adopting an overly critical or opinionated tone.
4.  **Final Deliverable:** The final output will be a tex-based PDF.
    -   **Formatting (Quotes):** Use `` and '' for double-quotes, and ` and ' for single quotes.
    -   **Formatting (Title):** The title-author-date block must be compact and use minimal vertical space.

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- The paper will not "pin failures on current practice" or adopt a polemical tone.
- The paper will not advocate for one methodology over another, but will instead analyze the characteristics of each.

## 6. Success Metrics

- The final paper is primarily descriptive and analytical in tone.
- The paper is well-supported by a broad range of scholarly sources.
- The writing style is simple and clear.
- The final PDF adheres to all specified formatting requirements.

## 7. Version 6: Renewed Focus on Energy

**Mandate:** Previous versions have successfully developed a framework for analyzing research methodologies and ethics, but have not sufficiently grounded this analysis in the specific context of the **energy sector**. Version 6 must correct this by explicitly and consistently centering the energy domain.

**Core Adjustments:**
1.  **Energy-Specific Case Studies:** The paper must move beyond general examples and instead draw on specific case studies from energy research. This includes, but is not limited to, studies on renewable energy transitions, fossil fuel project assessments, energy access in developing nations, and public engagement with energy infrastructure.
2.  **Targeted Literature Review:** The literature search will be revised to prioritize sources that are explicitly at the intersection of (1) research methodology, (2) research ethics, and (3) energy studies.
3.  **Explicit Connection:** Every claim linking a methodology to an ethical dimension must be supported by an example or citation from the energy literature. The guiding question is no longer just "How does X method relate to Y ethic?" but "How does X method relate to Y ethic *in the context of an energy-related problem?*"

## 8. Version 7: Integrating the Open Science Dimension

**Mandate:** Building on the energy-focused analysis of Version 6, Version 7 must integrate the role of **open science**. The final paper must not only map methodologies to ethics but also analyze how specific open science practices can be used to address the ethical challenges identified.

**Core Adjustments:**
1.  **Three-Pillar Analysis:** The core analysis must now connect three pillars: (1) Research Methodology, (2) Ethical Dimensions (Energy Justice), and (3) Open Science Solutions.
2.  **Targeted Open Science Literature Review:** The literature review must be expanded to include sources that specifically discuss open science in the context of energy, sustainability, and community-based research. Past project bibliographies should be leveraged for this.
3.  **Concrete Open Science Practices:** The analysis must move beyond a general endorsement of "openness" and discuss specific, concrete practices (e.g., open data, open-source hardware, FAIR principles, open access publishing, citizen science platforms) and explain how they can mitigate specific ethical risks. For example, how can open data make CBAs more transparent and contestable? How can open-source hardware facilitate genuine co-production in participatory projects?
