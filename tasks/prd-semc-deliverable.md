# PRD: SEMC Course Deliverable - The Role of Open Science in Ethical and Sustainable Energy Research

## 1. Introduction/Overview

This document outlines the requirements for creating a two-page reflection paper for the SEMC course. The paper's central goal is to present a credible argument on how open science practices can enhance the treatment of sustainability and ethics in energy research. The analysis will be initiated from the provided article, "The pivotal role of open source knowledge transfer to achieve universal energy access," and will be substantiated by a targeted literature search.

## 2. Goals

- **Primary Goal:** To produce a concise and compelling reflection paper of approximately two pages (excluding references).
- **Core Argument:** To satisfy the course's grading criteria by making a credible argument for how sustainability and ethics dimensions are addressed in energy research, and how open science can aid good research practice in this regard.
- **Methodological Focus:** The argument must weigh different methodology choices to address sustainability dimensions and ethical codes of conduct in scientific research.

## 3. User Stories

- As a student, I want to analyze the provided article on open source knowledge transfer to identify the core concepts at the intersection of open science, ethics, and sustainability in the energy sector.
- As a student, I want to perform a literature search using predefined keywords to gather a broader set of academic perspectives and evidence.
- As a student, I want to synthesize the findings from the initial article and the subsequent literature review to construct a coherent, central argument.
- As a student, I want to write a two-page paper that logically structures and presents this argument, supported by evidence from the collected literature.

## 4. Functional Requirements

1.  **Analyze Source Material:** The initial article, `The pivotal role of open source knowledge transfer to achieve universal energy access.md`, must be thoroughly analyzed to extract key themes and arguments.
2.  **Conduct Literature Search:** A literature search must be performed using search terms derived from the `.env` file to find relevant academic papers.
3.  **Synthesize Information:** The findings from the source article and the literature review must be synthesized to build a cohesive and well-supported argument.
4.  **Structure the Argument:** The paper should be structured logically around the central argument, rather than conforming to a rigid section-based format (e.g., Introduction, Body, Conclusion).
5.  **Draft the Paper:** A draft of the reflection paper, approximately two pages in length, must be written.
6.  **Manage References:** A consistent citation format must be used, and a complete reference list must be included.

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- The main body of the paper will not exceed the two-page limit.
- The scope of the argument will be confined to the energy research sector.
- The paper will not explore arguments or viewpoints unrelated to the core topic of open science, ethics, and sustainability.

## 6. Design Considerations (Optional)

- Not applicable. The deliverable is a text-based document.

## 7. Technical Considerations (Optional)

- The final deliverable will be in Markdown format.
- The literature search will be conducted using appropriate academic search tools.

## 8. Success Metrics

- The final paper meets all functional requirements and adheres to the specified length.
- The central argument is clear, logical, and directly addresses the assignment's prompt.
- The argument is well-supported by evidence from the provided article and the literature search.
- The entire process is systematically executed and documented according to the specified project rules.

## 9. Open Questions

- None at this stage.
