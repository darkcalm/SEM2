## Deliverables

- `deliverables/semc-reflection-paper.pdf` - The final, methodologically-focused PDF.

## Tasks (refer to @.cursor/rules/process-task-list before executing)

- [ ] 1.0 Parent Task: Research and Synthesis
  - [ ] 1.1 Synthesize Past Efforts
    - [ ] 1.1.1 Consolidate the synthesis documents from all three prior attempts (`archive/`, `archive_v2/`, `archive_v3/`) into a single foundational document `data/1.1.1-foundational-synthesis.md`.
  - [ ] 1.2 Conduct Methodological Research
    - [ ] 1.2.1 Formulate semantic search queries aimed at finding literature on **research methodologies** for assessing social and ethical dimensions of energy projects.
    - [ ] 1.2.2 Execute searches using Semantic Scholar and CORE to find relevant literature on methodologies.
    - [ ] 1.2.3 Create an annotated bibliography of the new methodology-focused papers in `data/1.2.3-methodology-bibliography.md`.
  - [ ] 1.3 Create Final Integrated Synthesis
    - [ ] 1.3.1 Create a final, unified synthesis in `data/1.3.1-final-synthesis.md` that integrates the foundational synthesis with the new findings on methodologies, creating a clear line of argument from flawed methods to ethical failures to open science solutions.

- [ ] 2.0 Parent Task: Formulate Argument and Draft Paper
  - [ ] 2.1 Formulate Final Argument
    - [ ] 2.1.1 Based on the final synthesis, formulate a thesis statement that explicitly incorporates the role of methodology. Save it to `docs/2.1.1-final-thesis.md`.
    - [ ] 2.1.2 Create a final outline in `docs/2.1.2-final-outline.md` that structures the paper around the integrated argument.
  - [ ] 2.2 Draft Final Paper (Deliverable)
    - [ ] 2.2.1 Create the final BibTeX file `deliverables/references.bib` by merging all relevant references.
    - [ ] 2.2.2 Write the final, integrated draft of the paper in `deliverables/semc-reflection-paper.tex`.
    - [ ] 2.2.3 Compile the LaTeX source to produce the final PDF, resolving any errors.
