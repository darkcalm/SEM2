# SEMC Course Deliverable: Methodology and Ethics in Energy Research

This repository contains the work for a two-page reflection assignment for the SEMC course. The assignment presents a descriptive and analytical overview of the relationship between research methodologies and ethical dimensions in the context of energy research.

## Repository Development History

This project was developed over seven distinct versions, with the archive of each major attempt preserved in the repository. This iterative process allowed for a progressive refinement of the core argument, moving from a broad exploration to a focused, three-part analysis. Each version represents a distinct stage in the research and writing process, and the archives are preserved to show the project's intellectual development.

- **`archive/` to `archive_v4/` (Versions 1-4):** Initial explorations that moved from a broad, normative framing toward a more focused, descriptive analysis of methodologies and ethics.
- **`archive_v5/` (Version 5):** A major shift to a purely descriptive framework, mapping methodological families to the ethical terrains of distributive, procedural, and recognition justice.
- **`archive_v6/` (Version 6):** Grounded the descriptive framework of V5 in a concrete energy sector case study (the La Guajira transmission line) to provide necessary specificity and depth.
- **`main` branch (Version 7):** The final version. This integrated the missing third pillar—**Open Science**—into the analysis, connecting specific open science practices (e.g., open data, open-source hardware) to the ethical challenges identified in the previous versions.
