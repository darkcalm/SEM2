# SEMC Course Deliverable: A Descriptive Analysis of Methodology and Ethics in Energy Research

This repository contains the work for a two-page reflection paper for the SEMC course at Carnegie Mellon University. The paper presents a descriptive and analytical overview of the relationship between research methodologies and ethical dimensions in the context of energy research.

## Repository Development History

This project has been developed over five distinct phases, with the archive of each major attempt preserved in the repository.

- **`archive/` (Version 1):** The initial exploration of the topic, focusing on a broad, foundational synthesis of concepts.
- **`archive_v2/` (Version 2):** A second attempt that narrowed the focus, concentrating on specific methodologies and their ethical implications.
- **`archive_v3/` (Version 3):** A third version that introduced a more balanced perspective, analyzing both the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches.
- **`archive_v4/` (Version 4):** The fourth iteration, which refined the analysis into a final, descriptive synthesis, moving away from normative claims.
- **`main` branch (Version 5):** The current and final version of the project, which builds on the synthesis from `archive_v4/` to produce the final deliverable.

This iterative process allowed for a progressive refinement of the core argument, moving from a broad exploration to a focused, descriptive analysis. Each version represents a distinct stage in the research and writing process, and the archives are preserved to show the project's intellectual development.
