# Project: The Role of Open Science in Ethical Energy Research

This repository documents the iterative process of creating a two-page reflection paper for the SEMC course. The final deliverable is a LaTeX-based PDF, `deliverables/semc-reflection-paper.pdf`.

## Development History

The final paper was the result of a systematic, three-phase development process, guided by your feedback to refine the argument and approach.

### Attempt 1 (`archive/`)

The first attempt focused broadly on the benefits of open science in energy research. The process involved:
- A literature search based on predefined keywords.
- Synthesis of findings on open science, ethics, and sustainability.
- Production of a LaTeX-based paper.

**Feedback:** The core requirement to analyze *how* sustainability and ethics are currently addressed was not sufficiently met. The keyword-based search was too rigid and did not adequately explore the nuances of current practices.

### Attempt 2 (`archive_v2/`)

The second attempt was a direct response to the feedback from the first. It course-corrected by focusing heavily on a critical analysis of current energy development practices. The process involved:
- A semantic literature search to find critiques of justice, equity, and community engagement in the energy sector.
- A deep synthesis of the "problem" side of the argument.
- Production of a new LaTeX-based paper.

**Feedback:** This version over-corrected and spent too little time on the "solution" aspectâ€”how open science can aid good research practice. The argument was no longer balanced.

### Attempt 3 (Final Version)

The final, successful attempt was designed to create a balanced and integrated argument. The process involved:
- A detailed synthesis of the most valuable findings from both previous attempts, combining the critique of current practices with the evidence for open science solutions.
- Formulation of a new, balanced thesis statement and outline that weaves the "problem" and "solution" together.
- A final revision of the paper to be more direct in its prose and to use a cleaner, more compact format.
- The final PDF was generated from `deliverables/semc-reflection-paper.tex`.

This iterative process, guided by your feedback, was crucial for producing a final document that is nuanced, well-supported, and directly addresses all facets of the assignment prompt.
