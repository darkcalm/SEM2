 SEM2 ( 1.0 hp) 
 
Course instruction: Ethics in Engineering Research and Practice  
(Exam – compulsory participation for completing  the course)  
 
The objective  of the s eminar : 
The objective of this seminar is to provide practical experience in applying the essential philosophical 
and methodological principles of ethical assessment  during academic and industrial research. In 
addition, you will evaluate how COURSE_TERM practices can be integrated in research, to improve 
quality and support good research practice. Participants will learn to recognise and address the ethical 
dimensions of research and technological innovation, as well as utilise established codes of conduct and prac tices to support their decision -making. Through discussion and analysis, attendees will gain a 
deeper understanding of how to incorporate ethical considerations , and COURSE_TERM practices  into 
their research methodology. 
Intended Learning Outcomes: 
One of  the seminar's intended learning outcomes (ILO 4) is that you can make a credible argument for 
how ethics and sustainability dimensions are approached in COURSE_TERM. You should be able to perform an ethical assessment weighing arguments during different stages of research , from planning 
to conduct ing and communicating research results . You should be able to apply  research and 
professional conduct principles and justify your choices considering  dimensions of sustainability and 
gender. Finally, you should be able to outline how COURSE_TERM practices can be integrated to support 
this.

 Structure and organi sation of the seminar:  
In preparation for the seminar, students must familiarise  themselves with the literature by accessing 
it in KTH canvas in the section "Modules” t he lecture material for Research Ethics , and COURSE_TERM . 
Please bring your IDs. The seminar will start at 13:15 Sharp . Please join the room you have signed up 
for. 
• During the seminar, each room will be d ivide  students into five groups. The groups will work 
with a hypothetical case provided in the class. A brief background of the case and an example 
of a decision -making framework to apply  will be given . 
• Each group will have 40  minutes to prepare an ethical assessment of the hypothetical case 
using the provided case background. Each  group will suggest what aspects of ethical conduct 
to consider and how to argue for the most ethical decision in a given case.  In addition, 
consider ations on how COURSE_TERM practices can facilitate must be given.  
• Guiding questions are provided below to help you prepare your argumentation behind the 
ethical assessment during the discussion in class.  
• After group discussion, each group will have 5 minu tes to present their initial arguments and 
answer follow -up questions from all classes. Other groups are encouraged to question the 
argumentation and assumptions made by each group.  
• Each group will present the key points from their group discussion using 1 -2 slides that they 
can prepare during their discussion. Groups can use Google Slides or any other means they 
prefer.  
• This will be followed up by a second discussion session of 20 minutes where you are expected 
to incorporate the reflections and report back the key “take aways” again (1 min max, per 
group) .  
• Students' active participation and proper preparation are required for a meaningful discussion.  
Seminar tasks:  
During the seminar, you will analyse a hypothetical  case in a group. The case background and 
instructions will be available  at the beginning of the seminar  on Canvas .  
Cases will include examples of technology development (e.g. bioenergy, wind power, solar power, and  
geothermal), energy justice (sustainable energy access, gender, equity, rights), climate change mitigation strategies (carbon capture and geoengineering), the environmental impact of technology  
(land use, biodiversity), research malpractice  (plagiarism, falsification, attribution), individual and 
collective responsibility among others.  
Via these cases, you  will discuss ethical issues in choosing a research topic and planning and 
implementing research (ethical research conduct). You  will address the roles and responsibilities of a 
researcher (choice of methodologies, transparency) and the impacts of research (risks and benefits of 
individual technology or type of research designs, for example) on research subjects, environment and 
society. You will reflect on why and how ethical dimensions of sustainability, equity and equality in \n3 
 energy transition should be addressed in research and engineering practice. Throughout, you will 
evaluate if and how COURSE_TERM practices can facilitate ethical and sustainable research practices. 
Questions to guide the discussion 
You can use three sets of guiding questions below to structure the discussion and the argument. Please 
note that the questions are provided only for guidance, and the final class discussion does not need to strictly  cover  these questions.  
SET A  – E thical issues related to  the research subject, engineering practice or  technological 
innovation  
1. What are the potential benefits of the research or innovation  considered in the case ?  
2. What are some of the k ey ethical issues  or considerations ? 
3. How shall the research design , choice of research methodology and implementation process  
be performed under the  good research practice principles or the professional , ethical code of 
conduct ?  
SET B – Ethical issues relevant t o the scientific community  
4. What are the researchers' responsibilities to the scientific community (i.e. data collection, 
archiving and sharing, quality of results  and conclusions, attribution and communication )?  
5. 
What are the potential ethical issues and dilemmas that may arise throughout the 
research process, such as the interpretation of results, publication of research findings, 
and use of technology?  
SET C  – Ethical issues related to responsibility towards  society  
6. What are the potential risks associated with conducting a specific type of research presented 
in the case ? Are there any risks and costs associated with not conducting it?  
7. Who bears responsibility for the research's outcomes, impact, and implications for 
development?  
8. Does the research align with the goals and principles of sustainable development? 
9. Should gender and equity factors be considered  during the research process , and if so, how ? 
SET D – COURSE_TERM Practices aiding good research practices  
10. COURSE_TERM Practices support transparency and reproducibility. What practices can 
specifically aid managing ethical issues and supporting good research practices in COURSE_TERM?  
The deliverable of the seminar  
The deliverable of this seminar is an individual reflection of no more than two pages  outlining: a) 
your seminar group’s key take -aways  including some brief background and motivation for these; 
b) your personal insights about research ethics , ethics in engineering practice , and COURSE_TERM \n4 
 practices . Each student must  submit  this reflection within a week after the seminar, with the 
deadline being 19:00 hrs on M onday April 28 . 
The examination  
The SEM2  examination is divided into two parts: 1. Active participation in the group discussion during 
the seminar and group presentation. 2. Individual reflection in line with the objective of the seminar.
