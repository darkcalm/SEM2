Is energy transition an 
ethical issue?\nWHAT WILL YOU LEARN
The objective of this lecture is to provide learners with
an understanding of the basic philosophical and
methodological principles behind ethical assessment
when conducting research and applying engineering
knowledge.
A summary of the major sources for ethical thinking
and examples of framework for decision-making in
research and practice will be introduced and discussed.
Ethical pressures in energy engineering and research
will be highlighted, including sustainability concerns of
energy transitions.

INTRODUCTION 
\nBatman is always right.
He is a superhero afterall. 
Or a ruthless vigilante? 
Joker is definitely an evil
villan. Or is he a social rebel
with a cause?WHY DO WE HAVE MORAL 
FRAMEWORKS?
RIGHT WRONG
Moral frameworks play an important role in shaping the 
moral fabric of societies, and to promote ethical behavior 
and social harmony: social cohesion, accountability, the 
rule of law, establishing expectations (norms), 
encouraging behavior based on moral values.\nWHAT IS ETHICS?
•The area of scholarship, a branch of philosophy
concerned with questions about what is morally 
right and wrong and how societies and 
individuals ought to behave. 
•Helps us to reflect on our own values and 
principles, and to understand the ethical 
implications of our actions and decisions
•Provides systematic approaches to the question:
“What should I do?”

\nPRACTICED BY EVERYONE
\n• The study of ethical acts.
• What people are ought to do.
• How people can decide what the 
‘correct’ moral actions to take are.How people can achieve moral 
outcomes in specific 
situations?
Specific fields of 
environmental ethics, 
bioethics, business ethics and 
etc.BROAD AREAS OF APPLICATION
\nETHICS FOR ENGINEERS AND 
RESEARCHERS
●Engineers enter the social coscial as they have a responsibility to 
consider the impact of their work and conduct on the society
●Research ethics: concerned with research practice
● Engineering ethics: concerned with actions and decisions made 
by engineers
●Ethics of technology: is the application of ethical thinking to the 
practical concerns of technology

PRINCIPLES
NORMATIVE AND APPLIED ETHICS
\n(SOME) NORMATIVE (WESTERN) ETHICAL 
THEORIES
Deontology
Argues that individuals have a moral duty to 
act by their moral principles and duties, even 
if doing so may not lead to the best overall 
outcome. Concerned with what people do , 
not with the consequences of their actions. 
Duty ethics concerns actions' inherent 
rightness or wrongness rather than their 
consequences. An example of duty ethics is 
the categorical imperative of Immanuel Kant, 
which states that people should always act 
according to maxims that could be turned 
into universal laws.
Rights and justice ethics emphasize the 
importance of respecting the rights of others 
and ensuring that justice is served in any 
given situation (Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights).Virtue Ethics
Teaches that an action is right if and only if it is 
an action that a virtuous person would take in 
the same circumstances. Intentions not 
consequences.
Eudaimonismethics branch : the virtues are
those qualities of character that lead to a 
fulfilling and flourishing life has happiness as 
the final goal.
Agent-based virtue ethics branch: the 
character of the individual agent, rather than 
on rules or principles. A virtuous person would 
act compassionately in a specific situation, 
rather than by the book. We have both 
permissions and obligations.Consequentialism
Seeks to maximize overall welfare, and 
so it evaluates actions based on the 
consequences they produce for all 
individuals affected by the action, not just 
the individual acting.
Universal Consequentialism : moral 
rightness depends on the consequences 
for all people or sentient beings (as 
opposed to only the individual agent, 
members of the individual’s society, 
present people, or any other limited 
group).
Total Consequentialism : moral rightness 
depends only on the total net good in the 
consequences (as opposed to the 
average net good per person).
\nConsequentialism Duty Virtue
Deliberative 
processWhat kind of 
outcomes should I 
produce?What are my obligations? 
What I should never do?What kind of person 
should I be? What my 
actions tell about my 
character?
FocusFuture effects of an 
action, for all who will 
be impactedFocuses on to the duties 
that exist prior to the 
situation and determines 
obligations.Discerning virtues and 
vices that are, or could 
be, motivating the in the 
situation.
Definition of 
Ethical ConductAction that will 
achieve the best 
consequencesInvolves always doing the 
right thing: never failing to 
do one's duty.Is whatever a fully 
virtuous person would do 
in the circumstances.
Motivation Aim is to produce the 
most good.Aim is to perform the right 
action.Aim is to develop a 
virtuous person.

\nFabrication
Fabrication is making up results and recording them 
as if they were real. 
Falsification
Falsification is manipulating research materials, 
equipment or processes or changing, omitting or 
suppressing data or results without justification.
Plagiarism
Plagiarism is using other people’s work and ideas 
without giving proper credit to the original source, 
thus violating the rights of the original author(s) to 
their intellectual outputs.MISCONDUCT
…is defined as:
Fabrication, falsification, and plagiarism 
committed wilfully or gross negligent in 
planning, performing, or reporting of 
research.
Source: Danish law on research misconduct, 2017
\nWARNING!!!
PLAGIARISM
Plagiarism is defined as submitting someone else’s work as your own. Including text
generated by a language model based on a combination of pre-existing language and
statistical patterns from collective large datasets.
Plagiarising violates your obligation to yourself to be truthful, and it violates your
obligation to society to provide fair and accurate information. Not contributing to
advancement of knowledge.

APPLIED AND 
PROFESSIONAL ETHICS
\n—Royal Academy of Engineering, Statement 
of Ethical Principles (UK)Professional engineers work to enhance the welfare, health 
and safety of all whilst paying due regard to the 
environment and the sustainability of resources. 
They have made personal and professional commitments to 
enhance the wellbeing of society through the exploitation 
of knowledge and the management of creative teams.

\nThe precautionary principle states that any action or 
policy that could carry a risk of causing (major) harm 
to the public or to the environment should not be 
carried out in the absence of scientific consensus
that the action or policy does not present any 
(major) risk, with the burden of proving the action is 
not harmful falling on those intending to take the 
action.THE PRECAUTIONARY PRINCIPLE
