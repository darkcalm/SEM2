2025 -04-01 2
\n2025 -04-01 3If you combine the human ability to identify patterns with:
•Pressure to achieve novel results (statistical significance) in a competitive field
•Small effect sizes
•Smaller studies
•Greater flexibility in design
•Financial interest\n2025 -04-01 4“…most published research findings 
are false ”
(Ioannidis 2005)\nA reproducibility crisis?
2025 -04-01 5
\nHow serious is this?
2025 -04-01 6•The “Reproducibility crisis” (Baker 2016) –many researchers have failed to 
reproduce their own or others’ studies.  
•Many studies are not able to be reproduced, including those using energy 
system modelling ( DeCarolis , Hunter, and Sreepathi 2012).
•What do we do about it?  
‒We write a manifesto for reproducible science (Munafò et al. 2017) .
‒Develop guidelines to follow
‒Incorporate good practices into our research\nOpen data and modelling in energy…
Strong movement since 2010s to move away from ”closed” or “proprietary” modelling
e.g. openmod initiative

\nWhat is COURSE_TERM?
“…transparent and accessible knowledge that is shared and developed through collaborative networks… ” 
“collaborative culture enabled by technology that empowers the open sharing of data, information, and knowledge 
within the scientific community and the wider public to accelerate scientific research and understanding “

movements and practices aiming to make 
multilingual scientific knowledge openly available, 
accessible and reusable for everyone, to increase 
scientific collaborations and sharing of information 
for the benefits of science and society, and to open 
the processes of scientific knowledge creation, 
evaluation and communication to societal actors 
beyond the traditional scientific community.”

FAIR principles
Regular curation and maintenanceOpen Research Data
\n15To be Interoperable:
•I1. (meta)data use a formal, accessible, shared, and 
broadly applicable language for knowledge 
representation.
•I2. (meta)data use vocabularies that follow FAIR 
principles
•I3. (meta)data include qualified references to other 
(meta)data
To be Reusable:
•R1. meta(data) are richly described with a plurality 
of accurate and relevant attributes
•R1.1. (meta)data are released with a clear and 
accessible data usage license
•R1.2. (meta)data are associated with detailed 
provenance
•R1.3. (meta)data meet domain -relevant community 
standardsTo be Findable:
•F1. (meta)data are assigned a globally unique and 
persistent identifier
•F2. data are described with rich metadata (defined 
by R1 below)
•F3. metadata clearly and explicitly include the 
identifier of the data it describes
•F4. (meta)data are registered or indexed in a 
searchable resource
To be Accessible:
•A1. (meta)data are retrievable by their identifier 
using a standardized communications protocol
•A1.1 the protocol is open, free, and universally 
implementable
•A1.2 the protocol allows for an authentication and 
authorization procedure, where necessary
•A2. metadata are accessible, even when the data are 
no longer availableFAIR Principles

\nExercise: COURSE_TERM Paper Autopsy
1. Select an (energy modelling) paper from the literature
2. List the steps you would take to reproduce the figures in the paper . Try to locate:
•Data sources (bonus points for the actual data set)
•Model source code (bonus points for the exact version of the code)
•Software and environment to run the model (bonus points for version)
•Code or documented steps to produce the figures
3. Can you think of anything else you would need to reproduce the work?
•Can you contact the author?\n19Usher, William, Beltramo , Agnese, Gardumi , Francesco,

20Attribution As research moves towards larger teams of contributors, all the people involved in the 
collaborative process of research process must be acknowledged.
Licensing A license clarifies what are the permitted uses of the work by other parties and rights of the 
author and user.
Metadata Metadata makes it possible for others to find your research, understand if they can use it, and 
then reference your work in their publications.
Pre-registration of research protocols Pre-registration makes a study less susceptible to bias, helps plan 
the research and provides an opportunity for peer feedback on the approach.
Referencing Referencing is a formal process of acknowledging all sources of information or work from 
other authors that you used when creating any original material.
Release A release process identifies a specific instance of a piece of continually updated software, data, 
tool or method and makes that instance findable and accessible.
Version Control Version Control Systems record a history of changes to source code, data, or other text -
based material enabling collaboration between distributed teams of researchers.
Workflow A computational workflow records the automated steps to transform data and code into 
research outputs.

\nExercise: COURSE_TERM Paper Audit
1. Return to the (energy modelling) paper you looked at earlier
2. With reference to the COURSE_TERM Practices ( https://climatecompatiblegrowth.github.io/guidelines/
determine which practices have been applied in the paper, and what recommendations you would give to the 
author to improve “Openness”\nConclusions
29•The movement towards COURSE_TERM is an antidote to the “reproducibility crisis”
•COURSE_TERM is a broad term
•In this lecture, we focus on what it means for producing a paper or report
•Behind an engineering, modelling or other scientific paper, there are numerous other artefacts 
of the research process including data, source code, lab protocols, surveys etc.
•By implementing COURSE_TERM practices, each of these artefacts can be made available for 
future scientific study.\nReferences
