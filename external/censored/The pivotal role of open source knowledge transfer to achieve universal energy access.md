SUMMARY
Community-company collaboration based on open source technologies is emerging as an alternative to pro-
prietary solutions for planning, implementation, and maintenance of localized access to clean renewableelectricity. We highlight some recent breakthroughs in creation of local technology ecosystems that followan open access approach to knowledge transfer. On the other hand, on top of engineering, manufacturing,
and maintenance questions, community led projects need to address social acceptance, economic viability,
and regulatory barriers. Despite these barriers, open source in energy access is expanding and new sustain-able business models are practiced. By comparing the advances in open source hardware scholarship withthat of free and open source software, we anticipate an increasing communal pressure for adopting open-source friendly innovation policies. Academia and in particular university knowledge transfer policies playan essential role in achieving universal energy access via open source technologies.
INTRODUCTION
Worldwide, close to 700 million people have no access to elec-
tricity and over 2 billion people have no possibility of cookingwith clean fuels and technologies (source: World Bank, 2022,
https://trackingsdg7.esmap.org/ ). United Nations Sustainable
Development Goal 7 has aimed at ‘‘access to affordable, reli-able, sustainable and modern energy for all’’ by 2030. Nine years
after setting this goal, there has been a remarkable progress in
providing energy in the Global North and most parts of Asia,but the progress is worryingly falling behind in sub-Saharan Af-
rica (see Figure 1 ). Considering the urgency of reducing depen-
dence on fossil fuels, accelerating access to clean energy sour-ces requires innovative approaches to planning, production, andmaintenance.
One of these radically distinct approaches to accelerating
access to renewable energy sources is to release the immensepotential of collaborative models and creating open source tech-
nology ecosystems. In this perspective, we highlight the advan-
tages and challenges of taking the open source route to energyaccess. We study the case of Open Source Energy Access Sym-
posium (OSEAS) in Abuja as an exemplary forum where some of
these advantages and challenges are discussed.
Empirical research has demonstrated how open source devel-
opment has increased innovation and technology adoption in
middle- and high-income economies while reducing costsacross various domains.
1–3The most visible universal impact
of open source technologies is in the informatics sector. As a
relatively mature technology, free and open source software
(FOSS) is the most studied open source ecosystem in the schol-arly literature. A recent study on the role of open source software
in the energy sector has collected and analyzed hundreds of
open source projects in this sector.4This study has concluded
that open source software has been successful in transformingindustries by accelerating development, lowering costs, and
ensuring stability and security. The majority of projects have
been initiated or are currently driven by academic contributors.Despite that, the authors conclude that the commercial energy
sector has benefited from applying open source principles to
address the unique challenges for expanding the renewable en-ergy network. The collaboration between academic and com-
mercial players in open source projects creates mutual benefits
particularly by standardization,
5increasing access to data, and
interoperability of services across the value chain.
After half a century of developing FOSS, despite the initially
fierce resistance of the big software corporation, open source
software has become one the main pillars of computing and in-formation technologies. An overall positive impact on economic
growth has been measured even for high-income economies.

Looking at the trend of scientific publications related to open
source software and open source hardware in Figure 2 ,i ti s
obvious that the latter is trailing the expansion of the former
with a delay of about 15 years. With the expansion of the openscience movement worldwide, we expect that this increasing
trend will continue, or even accelerate. Therefore, one can antic-
ipate that in year 2040, open source hardware will play a propor-tionally prominent role as open source software is doing today.Considering the rapid adoption of open source technologies by
local small businesses active for the energy sector in majority
countries, we expect this transition to be driven from local

OPEN ACCESS\ninitiatives, forcing the big corporation to follow course. Open
source planning software and generic interoperable hardware
(not strictly open source) are already playing a central role in agrowing ecosystem of small and medium energy providers de-
ploying minigrid systems in under-served communities. These
minigrid electricity suppliers play a crucial role in the clean en-ergy transition by providing access to African communities inareas that investing in large grids is lagging behind. Unlike big
infrastructure projects, minigrids are flexible, dependable, and
financially feasible for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) toset up and maintain.
4Under effective planning conditions, the
deployment of renewable energy sources through minigrid sys-
tems may be considered a more viable approach to supplyingproductive electricity to rural communities.
8–10This develop-
ment is akin to the leap from no telephone access to mobile com-
munications in many locations in Africa, skipping the land-linenetworks completely. While SMEs can play a crucial role in ex-
panding and sustaining the renewable energy access in African

nations they cannot invest in major up-
stream resources and tools such as
data-driven planning services or devel-opment of key basic technologies such
as batteries or power electronics
11,12or
financial transaction systems for com-mercial viability of these energy sup-pliers.
13These are some examples of
areas that still require global collabora-
tion and major investment in researchand development of open source tech-
nologies. The open source development of these technologies
is a fertile ground for fair and inclusive collaborations. A bi-direc-tional knowledge flow between technology and service pro-
viders and user communities is inherently necessary as these
tools can only be deployed properly when reliable data on energyneeds, actual demographics, and potential use-cases are madeavailable from the local operators.
DISCUSSIONCase study: Open source planning tools
Especially in sub-Saharan Africa, the demand for reliable elec-tricity is still surpassing supply. It remains a challenge to thor-
oughly assess the energy consumption needs of communities
that are still not even electrified. To fulfill the needs of external in-vestors, local operators should demonstrably identify commu-
nities with sufficient resources and economic growth potential
to secure a viable and durable impact of the investment. Onthe national or subnational scale, this exploration is mainly per-formed using geospatial planning tools that use a combination
of data sources to estimate the optimal distribution of resources
and identify potential risks. Developing such a complex platformis far beyond the capacity of a single SME. Hence, there is a large
demand for affordable geospatial planning solutions that lower
the entry barrier to the energy-providing sector. To answer thisneed the Energy Access Explorer (EAE) was initiated by the
World Resource Institute,
14which was the first fully open source
and locally led planning tool. The initial aim of the project at itsconceptualization was to reach 15 institutional users by year2020. Based on usage tracking, the beneficiaries of the EAE
are now exceeding 25,000 users, about fifteen hundred times
larger than the initial aim. The majority of these users are smalllocal businesses. This outstanding reach, beyond the initial ex-
pectations, highlights the opportunities that arise from making
such platform open source. Both the service providers as wellas for the local operators benefit from the open access. Mean-
while, there are several other solution providers that are also
walking the open access route; see Table 1 for non-exhaustive
list. While expansion of the open source toolbox is a generally

operable open source tools have some negative sides that wewill discuss later in the section ‘‘ pitfalls of open source
development .’’
From open source planning to open source distributed
manufacturing
Next to effective planning based on digital tools and data, ac-
cess to clean electricity requires materials and physical equip-ment. Fortunately, in contrast with high-CapEx infrastructure
projects, mini-grids are inherently compatible with distributed
manufacturing. Many solution providers in low coverage areasare small and medium businesses (SMEs). In the relatively youngrenewable energy market, hardware manufacturers are still
diverse in scale and quality. It can thus be a major overhead
cost for these SMEs to evaluate and build durable supplychains. Therefore, the minigrid supply chain and maintenance
ecosystem can still benefit a lot from standardization and collab-
oration, to collectively reach an economy of scale. Some pio-neers have created open source hardware technologies for
various elements of a minigrid such as for monitoring,
21electric
vehicle (EV) charging,22battery management,23or design of the
complete system.24
In a growing market where demand far exceeds supply, pro-
tection of intellectual property for the sake of vendor lock-in isa general hindrance with a high financial and opportunity cost,and little or no benefit on productivity.
25Relying on specialized
non-standard parts that are not at the core business of each
company reduces the overall impact of the sector in comparisonwith incumbent fossil-based energy providers. Particularly, in a
sector with a significant share of public and philanthropic money
being used, focus on maximizing impact and reach should get ahigher priority than market domination. Based on this realization,
some of the philanthropic investors have focused on de-risking
the development of open source technologies by directlyfinancing those to keep the source open.
Case study: Investing exclusively on open source
One example of such philanthropic initiative is the EnAccessfoundation. Since 2007, this foundation has focused on
removing the barriers to knowledge sharing at the system level.
One of the most successful examples of EnAccess’s opensource policy is the OpenPayGO Token, which is compatible
across different platforms, and manufacturers.
13,26Pay As You
Go (PAYG) is a business model that has gained considerable
traction by breaking down purchases of equipment and fuel
into affordable micropayments and providing a mechanismthrough which low-income households can access new technol-ogies. The pure encryption and decryption of access tokens is
generally of no business value to any of those actors, but the
lack of orchestration had created incompatible codes and un-necessary complexity. The OpenPayGO Token has pushed
several other operators in Africa to support interoperability and
hence become more efficient.
Serving the same community of stakeholders, EnAccess and
World Resources Institute (WRI) jointly organized the first
OSEAS 2024. A very diverse audience, from open source devel-opers and academic researchers to government officials, donor
representatives, and business owners were brought together in
Abuja, Nigeria, to share their insights and co-design a path forstronger collaboration in the future. The conscious choice oforganizing the symposium in Nigeria had enabled strong pres-
ence from countries in the global south.
This growing community is undoubtedly unified on the higher
goal of making universal access to clean sustainable energy a re-
ality. By sharing the overhead costs of technology development,
project planning, and education, these actors have achieved agreat deal in electrifying regions that had insufficient access to
modern energy services. The diversity of the speakers in gender,
background, and specialization was remarkably broad. Thisneed for diversity, both in the open source developers commu-nity, and energy access was emphasized repeatedly during the
symposium.
The organizers highlight these 10 recommendations in their
final report.
(1) Leverage open-source platforms like the Global Electrifi-
cation Platform for cost-effective, standardized geo-
spatial analysis in electrification planning.
(2) Develop training programs to build capacity among en-
ergy professionals in developing countries for using
open-source tools in energy planning.
(3) Form partnerships with universities, research organiza-
tions, and stakeholders to develop and implement
open-source solutions and replicate successful models.Table 1. A list of open source software tools for geospatial planning

tries, in planning to ensure solutions align with local
needs and priorities.
(5) Ensure open-source tools are transparent, publicly avail-
able, and user-friendly, with adequate training and sup-
port.
(6) Increase funding for research and development in high-
capacity, affordable battery technologies, focusing on
both fundamental research and applied innovation.
(7) Foster international collaboration for technology trans-
fer, best practices sharing, and learning from global
renewable energy projects to speed up the energy tran-
sition.
(8) Enhance women’s participation in technology design,
testing, and maintenance, involving them as active con-
tributors.
(9) Invest in capacity-building to raise awareness of funding
sources and improve data management for reliable
investor engagement.
(10) Define roles and responsibilities in data governance and
promote collaboration among stakeholders for effective
data management.
These recommendations highlight the continuing ambitions of
the open source community to achieve tangible progress in the
energy sector. It is also an open call to international organiza-
tions and policy makers to become more conscious of the ben-efits of using the public domain innovations and invest in theinfrastructure that can support this energy access commons.
Pitfalls of open source development
While open source projects are praised for lowering the entry
barrier for contributors, as bottom up initiative they often lack acomprehensive governance structure or a resources develop-
ment roadmap. Some projects thin down by branching into par-
allel track or turn into niche applications that are not all interop-erable. Although, existence of alternatives and avoiding a
monopoly is generally seen as a positive factor that ensures
innovation and improves the services, every extra planning tooloffered will cause extra overhead to adopters such as the localand national government for assessment and selection. The
lack of coordination in providing planning tools is inefficient
because of these assessment costs that can cause delays inthe implementation. A collaborative approach to quality control
and task distribution between the various open source providers
can create a good common ground for ensuring an adequateand efficient high quality service and preservation of community
values.
For the case of geo-spatial planning services the OSEAS sym-
posium served as an opportunity for collaboration between sofar distinct open source planning projects. The project represen-
tatives shared their vision and decided to develop a common
roadmap for collaboration in the upcoming year and to presentthat in the next symposium.
Market-driven open source business models
Beside advantages for resource sharing, innovation acceleration,
and standardization, the recent path of adopting open sourcesoftware and hardware by some of the biggest tech-companies
has proven that adopting open source can be deliberate and
rational economic choice. Some companies emphasize their
choice of open source to emphasize transparency and reliabilityof their products, as a market advantage, or to rapidly obtain a
larger user base. Dedicating resources of (for-profit) companies
to maintaining open source project is justified based on thecost savings for reliability, ease of maintenance, productcompatibility, and sustaining upstream dependencies.
Next to well-established open-source projects that benefit
from the critical mass of their developer communities, somestart-ups choose to build their business around these estab-
lished or emerging open source technologies based on new
and creative business models.
27,28
These models include, but are not limited to the following:
(1) The open core model: The core of the software or hard-
ware is open source, but additional proprietary features
or enhancements are offered for a fee.
(2) Services around open source products: Commercial ser-
vices are offered around free and open source products;
for example consulting, training, and technical support.This model uses specific expertise to generate revenuewithout earning from selling the product itself.
(3) Platform/data service providers: Under this model, busi-
nesses provide hosting of open-source products andrent the service to users via subscriptions or customized
services. This model adds value for users through ease
of use, scalability, and maintenance, while the providercan benefit from the economy of scale.
(4) Branding and reselling: For some software products and
especially for open-source hardware, end users arewilling to pay an additional fee for quality management
and after-sale services. This model has been successfully
applied to some consumer-grade open source hardware.
Also, a combination of different models is being used by com-
panies. For instance, providing paid premium hosting services
and offering additional services around the products work
greatly together.
On the role of academia
While the local governments, businesses, civil society, finance
institutions are focusing on extending services to access-
deprived regions with the existing tools and technologies, me-dium-long term sustainability of open source solutions remains
a challenge. This is an area where academic institutions can
contribute through curriculum development, training of trainers,and adopting and enhancing open source technology as part of
academic dissertations.
1,29
When focusing on distributed manufacturing and services,
long-term maintenance is almost as important a design factoras innovation in performance. While academic research is
often focused on innovation and pushing the boundaries for
production or storage efficiency, without maintenance, suchsolutions will be of little use for the long-term use by local ser-
vice providers and end-users. Therefore, it is important to
consider the availability of local resources and expertise as
4 iScience 28, 112093, March 21, 2025iScienc e
Perspectivell
OPEN ACCESS\npart of the technical solutions. Open source solutions are
transparent and inherently extendable to the complete mate-
rial and technological chain of supply. Additionally, the useful-
ness of any technological solution is ultimately determined byits fitness to local conditions and constraints. The flexibility of
open source solutions and involvement of the local developers
community accommodates matching of needs and servicesfrom the bottom up, including the local higher education pro-viders. The reduced cost of creative commons licensing re-
moves the financial barrier for low-income countries in using
proprietary solutions.
For a faster scaling of such capacities and a natural embed-
ding of the regional ecosystem of knowledge, it is commendable
for well-established academic groups to invest in partnershipwith local academic institutions. This route requires a long-
term perspective on knowledge transfer, but can offer a more
sustainable and rapidly scaling up by domesticating the neces-sary expertise and adaptation to local geopolitical and humancapacities. Local academic institutions can play a crucial role
in developing a skilled workforce for the energy sector, particu-
larly in the fields of high social relevance. Furthermore, suchcollaboration can lead to the alignment of policy recommenda-
tions for international donor agencies, national policymakers,
and local development planners, thereby addressing existingchallenges and future prospects of preserving the locally avail-
able expertise.
The path forward
The COURSE_TERM movement has grown from a progressiveeffort focusing on best scientific practices to the mainstream
of funding policies. The United States federal government
announced 2023 as the year of COURSE_TERM featuring severalnational initiatives. In the same year, United Nation’s United Na-
tions Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)
published its recommendations on COURSE_TERM as a frameworkfor making knowledge inclusive, equitable, and sustainable. It is
one of the recommendation of the UNESCO
30COURSE_TERM pol-
icy paper that well-established research universities of the globalnorth can further enhance the open source knowledge transferby adopting a more permissive and non-exclusive licensing
regime for their innovations that are at lower technological read-
iness level. The UNESCO recommendations also recommendworking with open principles to accelerate toward reaching the
sustainable development goals. Wide spread adoption of this
policy can be a game changer in democratizing and enrichingaccess to clean technologies, in the global north and global
south simultaneously.
This mindset shift requires a higher awareness of the benefits
and impact of open source solutions among the governance
boards and especially the knowledge transfer offices of estab-
lished research universities.
2,31
Meanwhile, bottom up initiative can become more coherent by
forming open source communities around open source project.
The high moral motivation for accelerating the transition to
renewable energies, to overcome the worse scenarios ofclimate, is a unifying element that attracts the new generation
of researchers and energy practitioner to choose open source in-
novations for contributing to the common good.Limitations of the study
This perspective article is mainly built on the experience of the
authors with development of open source solutions over the
past ten years and their interaction with the expanding opensource community active in the fields of geospatial planning,
local energy access solutions, and COURSE_TERM education.
The comparison between advances of open source softwareand open source hardware is only partially legitimate as hard-ware is not a purely digital product that can be copied with negli-
gible marginal cost. This material cost however, is rapidly
reducing in comparison with the costs for development andmaintenance, which is common between software and hard-
ware. Future work on the role of open source in entrepreneurial
ecosystems will require a closer look at legal obstacles and theregulatory frameworks that may be lagging behind the rapid tran-
sition to open source solutions. Open source hardware develop-
ment also requires a redefinition of productivity and market valu-ation as the actual value of such open source products andservices are mostly based on saving costs rather than supply
and demand dynamics and price allocation by rational agents
in a competitive market.
