### Annotated Bibliography: The State of Ethics and Sustainability in Energy Research

This bibliography synthesizes findings from literature that critically examines current practices in energy development, focusing on community engagement, benefit sharing, and justice.

1.  **Ryder, S., et al. (2023). "Do the ends justify the means? Problematizing social acceptance and instrumentally-driven community engagement in proposed energy projects."**
    *   **Annotation:** This paper is foundational for the critique of current practices. It argues that much "community engagement" is merely instrumental, a "tick-box" exercise designed to achieve social acceptance rather than foster genuine participation. This leads to community distrust and frustration. The paper provides direct evidence of how developer-led engagement often fails to meet best practices, treating communities as obstacles to be managed rather than partners. It will be used to build the argument that current top-down models are ethically flawed.

2.  **Eisenson, M., & Webb, R. M. (2023). "Expert Insights on Best Practices for Community Benefits Agreements."**
    *   **Annotation:** This report provides a detailed, practical guide to Community Benefit Agreements (CBAs). While offering "best practices," it simultaneously reveals the shortcomings of typical approaches. It highlights that negotiations should be framed around mitigating project impacts, not "buying community support." This distinction is crucial and reveals the often-transactional and ethically questionable nature of many CBAs. It provides concrete examples of how to structure more equitable agreements, which will be used to contrast with current flawed practices.

3.  **Hannon, M., et al. (2023). "Community participation for community benefits from natural capital projects."**
    *   **Annotation:** This review offers a robust theoretical framework, defining "community benefit" not just as financial input but as a demonstrable uplift in community wellbeing. It connects project-level benefits to the broader strategy of Community Wealth Building (CWB), which aims to create more democratic and locally controlled economies. This is a powerful concept for the paper's argument, as it provides a tangible alternative to extractive models. The ten guiding principles for participation will serve as a benchmark against which current practices can be judged and found wanting.

4.  **Sovacool, B. K., & Dworkin, M. H. (2015). "Energy justice: Conceptual insights and practical applications." (Implicitly referenced in other papers, provides foundational concepts).**
    *   **Annotation:** This article (foundational for others in the search) defines the key tenets of energy justice: distributive (who gets the benefits/burdens), procedural (who decides), and recognition (whose voices are heard). This framework is essential for structuring the paper's critique. It allows for a systematic analysis of *how* current energy development models create injustice by misallocating benefits, centralizing decision-making, and ignoring marginalized voices.

5.  **Eales, A. (2024). "Global Perspectives on Community Energy for a Just Transition."**
    *   **Annotation:** This report provides a compelling alternative model through the concept of "community energy twinning." By showcasing a partnership between UK and African community energy systems, it offers a practical example of a non-extractive, collaborative approach rooted in global citizenship and climate justice. This case study will be used as a powerful counter-narrative to the developer-led, profit-driven models critiqued elsewhere, demonstrating that a more ethical and equitable path is possible.
