### Final Paper Outline

**Title:** Beyond the Bottom Line: A Methodological Argument for Open Science in Energy Research

**1. Introduction**
    -   **Hook:** Start with a brief vignette of a community benefit agreement failing, illustrating the "instrumental" paradigm.
    -   **Thesis Statement:** Present the final thesis, arguing that the failures are methodological and that open science offers a methodological solution.
    -   **Roadmap:** Briefly outline the paper's structure: critique of current methods, analysis of institutional inertia, and the alternative methodological paradigm offered by open science.

**2. The Methodological Roots of Ethical Failure**
    -   **Topic:** Argue that dominant research methods (e.g., CBA, top-down surveys) are not neutral tools but are political choices that create ethical problems.
    -   **Evidence 1 (The Illusion of Objectivity):** Discuss how these methods reduce complex justice issues to single variables, ignoring procedural and recognition justice (Sovacool & Dworkin, 2015).
    -   **Evidence 2 (Case Study in Flawed Methods):** Use Chester (2018) to show how assuming a "rational consumer" leads to unjust solar deployment models, demonstrating a concrete failure of methodological assumptions.

**3. Institutional Inertia: Why Good Intentions Fail**
    -   **Topic:** Argue that the problem is systemic, not just individual. Even researchers who want to use better methods are locked in by the current academic/research system.
    -   **Evidence (The JUST-R Case):** Use Arkhurst et al. (2023) as the primary evidence. Detail their finding that frameworks for encouraging justice thinking fail because of institutional barriers: lack of funding, time, incentives, and expertise. This demonstrates the "methodological lock-in."

**4. Open Science as a Methodological Revolution**
    -   **Topic:** Frame open science not just as "open data," but as a new paradigm that enables a fundamental shift in research *methodology*.
    -   **Argument 1 (Enabling Methodological Pluralism):** Explain how open tools and data provide the necessary infrastructure for more just methods like Participatory Action Research (PAR) and in-depth qualitative studies, directly countering the methods critiqued in Section 2.
    -   **Argument 2 (The OSAT Example):** Use Open Source Appropriate Technology (OSAT) as the ultimate example of a methodological shift. It's not just an output; its flexible, adaptable nature represents a *co-productive* research process, moving beyond extractive models entirely (Rana et al., 2023; Pearce, 2019).

**5. Conclusion**
    -   **Restate Thesis:** Reiterate the core argument in a new, compelling way.
    -   **Synthesize and Summarize:** Briefly summarize the logical flow: flawed methods cause failure, institutions lock in those methods, and open science provides the methodological key to unlock a better paradigm.
    -   **Call to Action/Concluding Thought:** End with a call for research institutions and funders to move beyond surface-level DEI initiatives and invest in the deep, methodological, and structural changes required for a truly just energy transition.
