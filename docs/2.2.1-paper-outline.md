### Reflection Paper Outline

**Title:** Beyond the Bottom Line: Democratizing Power in the Energy Transition

**1. Introduction**
    *   **Hook:** Start with the paradox of the energy transition: a project meant to ensure planetary sustainability that often creates local injustice.
    *   **Context:** Introduce the dominant, top-down model of energy development.
    *   **Thesis Statement:** Present the formulated thesis: While the energy transition is framed as a sustainable imperative, its dominant, top-down implementation perpetuates energy injustice through "instrumental" community engagement that prioritizes project acceptance over genuine partnership. A truly just and sustainable transition requires a paradigm shift, moving beyond flawed benefit-sharing schemes to embrace open science and community-led models that build local wealth and democratize power.

**2. The Illusion of Participation: Deconstructing "Instrumental" Community Engagement**
    *   **Argument:** Argue that the prevailing model of community engagement is ethically and functionally bankrupt.
    *   **Evidence:**
        *   Define "instrumental" or "tick-box" engagement (Ryder et al.).
        *   Explain how Community Benefit Agreements (CBAs) are often used as a transactional tool to "buy" acceptance, not to mitigate harm (Eisenson & Webb).
        *   Use the Energy Justice framework (Sovacool & Dworkin) to show how this model fails on procedural and recognition justice.

**3. The Alternative: Building Power Through Community-Led Models and Open Science**
    *   **Argument:** Propose a shift from transactional relationships to transformative partnerships.
    *   **Evidence:**
        *   Introduce Community Wealth Building (CWB) as a guiding strategy that moves beyond simple compensation (Hannon et al.).
        *   Showcase a concrete alternative model: community energy twinning, which fosters collaboration instead of extraction (Eales).
        *   Connect this to the initial article's thesis: Explain how open science, open data, and open-source hardware are the *enabling tools* for this new paradigm. They break down information asymmetry and empower communities to become active participants and owners, not just stakeholders.

**4. Conclusion**
    *   **Synthesize:** Reiterate the core argument: the difference between transactional and transformative engagement.
    *   **Call to Action:** Conclude that achieving a truly just transition requires a dual commitment: a shift in our ethical frameworks (towards CWB and energy justice) and a commitment to the tools (open science) that can make that shift a reality.
