### Reflection Paper Outline

**Title:** Open for Power: How Open Science Can Forge a Just and Sustainable Energy Future

**1. Introduction**
    *   **Hook:** Start with the urgency of the dual climate and energy access crises.
    *   **Context:** Briefly introduce the concept of the global energy transition as more than a technological problemâ€”it is an ethical one.
    *   **Thesis Statement:** Present the formulated thesis statement.

**2. The Ethical Failures of a Closed Energy System**
    *   **Argument:** Argue that current "closed" models of energy research and development perpetuate injustice and are ill-suited for the challenges we face.
    *   **Evidence:**
        *   Discuss the lack of transparency and reproducibility in energy research (Alonso Pedrero, Fell).
        *   Introduce the concepts of distributive and procedural justice (Miller) and show how proprietary, top-down energy projects often fail these ethical tests (Bethem et al. - DAP case).

**3. The Open Science Paradigm: A Framework for Ethical Research**
    *   **Argument:** Propose open science as the necessary alternative framework.
    *   **Evidence:**
        *   Explain the core tenets of open science: open data, open source, open access, open hardware.
        *   Show how transparency builds trust and accelerates innovation (Fell, Alonso Pedrero).
        *   Connect open science to good research practice and its role in upholding scientific integrity.

**4. Open Source Appropriate Technology (OSAT): Putting Principles into Practice**
    *   **Argument:** Argue that OSAT is the tangible manifestation of an open and ethical energy transition.
    *   **Evidence:**
        *   Use the solar PV racking case study (Rana et al.) to show how OSAT allows for local adaptation and context-specific solutions, empowering communities.
        *   Use the open-source ball mill case study (Mottaghi et al.) to demonstrate how OSAT makes critical technology more accessible and sustainable.
        *   Connect these examples back to the principles of distributive and procedural justice (Miller).

**5. Conclusion**
    *   **Restate Thesis:** Rephrase the thesis in light of the evidence presented.
    *   **Synthesize Main Points:** Briefly summarize the arguments about the failures of closed systems and the promise of open science/OSAT.
    *   **Call to Action/Concluding Thought:** End with a powerful statement about the responsibility of the energy research community to lead this ethical transformation.
