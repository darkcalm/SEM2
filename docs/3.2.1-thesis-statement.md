In energy research, methodological choices are not ethically neutral; they structure the moral landscape by prioritizing certain dimensions of justice—such as the distributive focus of cost-benefit analyses, the recognition focus of ethnography, or the procedural focus of participatory action research. This paper descriptively analyzes this relationship, arguing that specific open science practices—such as open data for quantitative models, open access for qualitative findings, and open-source hardware for participatory projects—offer practical pathways for researchers to navigate these inherent ethical trade-offs more transparently and equitably.
