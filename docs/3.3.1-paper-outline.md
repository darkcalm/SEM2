# V7 Paper Outline: Methodology, Ethics, and Open Science

**Title:** Methodology, Justice, and Open Science in Energy Research

**1. Introduction**
    -   Hook: The increasing complexity of energy research demands careful consideration of methodology.
    -   Thesis Statement: In energy research, methodological choices are not ethically neutral; they structure the moral landscape by prioritizing certain dimensions of justice. This reflection descriptively analyzes this relationship, arguing that specific open science practices offer practical pathways for researchers to navigate these inherent ethical trade-offs more transparently and equitably.
    -   Roadmap: Briefly introduce the three-part structure (Method -> Justice -> Open Science Solution) that will be used to analyze quantitative, qualitative, and participatory methods.

**2. The Ethical Dimensions of Quantitative Methods & the Role of Open Data**
    -   **Methodology:** Describe quantitative methods (e.g., Cost-Benefit Analysis).
        -   Focus: Aggregation, economic efficiency, standardization.
    -   **Ethical Terrain: Distributive Justice**
        -   Explain how CBAs are primarily oriented towards distributive justice.
        -   Case Study (La Guajira): Show how this focus can obscure issues of recognition and procedural justice, creating ethical conflicts (Vega-Araújo & Heffron, 2022).
    -   **Open Science Solution: Open Data**
        -   Describe how making CBA models and data open enhances transparency and contestability.
        -   Explain that this practice helps address the procedural shortcomings of "black box" analyses.

**3. The Ethical Dimensions of Qualitative Methods & the Role of Open Access**
    -   **Methodology:** Describe qualitative methods (e.g., Ethnography, semi-structured interviews).
        -   Focus: Lived experience, meaning, context.
    -   **Ethical Terrain: Recognition Justice**
        -   Explain how these methods excel at bringing issues of recognition justice to the forefront.
        -   Case Study (La Guajira): Use the example of identifying the correct community leaders to show the power of qualitative methods (Vega-Araújo & Heffron, 2022).
    -   **Open Science Solution: Open Access & FAIR Data**
        -   Describe how Open Access ensures research findings reach the subject communities and a wider audience.
        -   Discuss how FAIR data principles provide a framework for ethical data sharing, protecting participant anonymity while maximizing knowledge value.

**4. The Ethical Dimensions of Participatory Methods & the Role of Open-Source Hardware**
    -   **Methodology:** Describe participatory methods (e.g., Participatory Action Research).
        -   Focus: Co-production, empowerment, democratization.
    -   **Ethical Terrain: Procedural Justice**
        -   Explain how these methods are explicitly designed to embody procedural justice.
        -   Case Study (Australian Wind Farms): Note the challenge of ensuring genuine, not superficial, participation (Gross, 2007).
    -   **Open Science Solution: Open-Source Appropriate Technology (OSAT)**
        -   Describe how OSAT provides tangible tools for community co-design and ownership (Pearce, 2019).
        -   Explain how this transforms participation into a more robust form of procedural justice.

**5. Conclusion**
    -   Synthesize the three-part analysis, restating the core argument.
    -   Broader Implication: The choice of research methodology in the energy field is a critical ethical decision.
    -   Concluding Thought: An awareness of the link between methods, justice, and open science is essential for conducting responsible and impactful energy research that is both scientifically sound and ethically robust.
