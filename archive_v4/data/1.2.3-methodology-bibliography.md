### Annotated Bibliography: Methodologies in Energy Justice Research

*   **Arkhurst, B. K., Houghteling, C. R., Dutta, N. S., Clarke, A., Fu, K., Anderson, K., & Gill, E. (2023). Evaluating energy justice metrics in early-stage science and technology research using the JUST-R metrics framework. *Frontiers in Environmental Science*, 11, 1206013.**
    *   **Annotation:** This paper is a meta-analysis of the "JUST-R" framework, a tool designed to integrate energy justice considerations into early-stage R&D. The study evaluates the *effectiveness of this methodological intervention*. Its key finding is that while such frameworks are effective at raising awareness and helping researchers identify problems, they are largely ineffective at producing actual changes in research design or application of solutions. The paper identifies significant institutional barriers—lack of time, funding, incentives, and relevant data—and a lack of specific expertise as the primary reasons for this failure.
    *   **Relevance:** This paper provides crucial, direct evidence for the core argument. It demonstrates that even when researchers are prompted to consider justice, the "status quo" methodologies and institutional structures create a powerful inertia that prevents meaningful change. It highlights a key methodological challenge: the methods used to *evaluate* research (like the JUST-R framework) must be accompanied by institutional support to be effective. It shows the limitations of purely analytical or "checklist" approaches to justice.

*   **Chester, L. (2018). *New forms of solar PV provisioning needed to advance energy justice for lower income households*. Asia-Pacific Solar Research Conference, UNSW.**
    *   **Annotation:** This paper examines the failure of existing solar PV adoption models to serve low-income households in Australia, framing it as a form of energy injustice. It critiques the methodological assumption of the "rational, self-interested" consumer who responds only to price signals. The research itself uses qualitative methods (focus groups) to uncover deeper, trust-based barriers to adoption. It explicitly compares different business models for solar deployment (e.g., customer-owned, third-party owned, community-owned), which represent different real-world methodologies for implementing energy technology.
    *   **Relevance:** This paper provides a concrete case study of how flawed methodological assumptions (over-reliance on economic rationality) lead to unjust outcomes. It contrasts this with more appropriate qualitative methodologies (focus groups) that can uncover the real-world complexities of trust and community. The comparison of different ownership/business models serves as a perfect example of "weighing different methodology choices" in the implementation of energy systems.
