# PRD: SEMC Course Deliverable - A Balanced Argument for Open Science in Energy Research

## 1. Introduction/Overview

This document outlines the requirements for a two-page reflection paper for the SEMC course. The paper must present a **balanced and integrated argument**, first critically analyzing the current treatment of sustainability and ethics in energy research, and then demonstrating how open science practices offer a concrete and necessary path forward. The argument will be built by synthesizing resources from two previous analytical attempts.

## 2. Goals

- **Primary Goal:** To produce a concise and compelling reflection paper of approximately two pages (excluding references).
- **Core Argument:** To build a balanced argument that **(a)** critically analyzes how sustainability and ethics dimensions are currently addressed in energy research, identifying common failings, and **(b)** convincingly argues how open science can aid good research practice and remedy these specific failings.
- **Methodological Focus:** The argument must weigh different methodology choices to address sustainability dimensions and ethical codes of conduct in scientific research.

## 3. User Stories

- As a student, I want to synthesize the findings from two previous attempts to establish a comprehensive understanding of the problem (ethical failings) and the proposed solution (open science).
- As a student, I want to perform a targeted semantic literature search to fill any identified gaps, ensuring both sides of the argument are equally well-supported.
- As a student, I want to construct a single, coherent thesis statement and outline that integrates the critique of current practices with the advocacy for open science.
- As a student, I want to write a two-page paper that flows logically from the problem to the solution, giving equal weight and depth to both parts of the argument.

## 4. Functional Requirements

1.  **Synthesize Past Efforts:** The analysis from both `archive/` and `archive_v2/` must be reviewed and synthesized. This includes the critique of "instrumental" engagement (from v2) and the benefits of Open Source Appropriate Technology (from v1).
2.  **Balanced Literature Review:** A new literature synthesis will be created, drawing the strongest evidence from both previous attempts to support both the "problem" and "solution" parts of the argument.
3.  **Integrated Argument:** The paper's structure must not be a simple "problem then solution" format, but must weave the two together, showing how specific open science practices directly address specific ethical failings.
4.  **Draft and Refine:** A single, polished draft of the paper will be created, ensuring the two parts of the argument are balanced in length and depth.
5.  **Final Deliverable:** The final output will be a tex-based PDF with a complete reference list.

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- The paper will not treat the problem and solution as two separate, disconnected essays.
- The paper will not exceed the two-page limit (excluding references).

## 6. Technical Considerations (Optional)

- The literature synthesis will be based on the successful semantic searches from the previous two attempts.

## 7. Success Metrics

- The final paper dedicates roughly equal space and depth to analyzing the problem and presenting the open science solution.
- The central argument is clear, logical, and seamlessly integrates the two parts.
- The argument is well-supported by a balanced set of evidence from the previous attempts.

## 8. Open Questions

- None at this stage.
