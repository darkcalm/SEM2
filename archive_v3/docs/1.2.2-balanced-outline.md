### Balanced Paper Outline

**Title:** Architects of a Just Transition: From Instrumental Engagement to Open Empowerment

**1. Introduction**
    *   **Hook:** Introduce the ethical paradox of the energy transition: a sustainable goal undermined by unjust methods.
    *   **Problem:** Briefly describe the dominant, top-down model and its "instrumental" approach to community engagement.
    *   **Thesis Statement:** Present the new, balanced thesis statement.

**2. The Hollow Promise of "Engagement": Analyzing the Instrumental Paradigm**
    *   **Argument:** Argue that the current model is designed to manage dissent, not foster partnership, which is an ethical failure.
    *   **Evidence:**
        *   Detail the "tick-box" mentality and transactional nature of CBAs (Ryder, Eisenson & Webb).
        *   Use the energy justice framework (Sovacool, Miller) to diagnose this as a failure of procedural and recognition justice.
        *   Connect this procedural failure to the opaque, closed-data research practices that reinforce it (Alonso Pedrero, Fell).

**3. The Open Science Solution: A Framework for Genuine Partnership**
    *   **Argument:** Argue that open science provides a direct, practical remedy to the failures of the instrumental paradigm.
    *   **Evidence:**
        *   Show how open data and methods directly counter research opacity and build trust.
        *   Explain how access to information is a prerequisite for meaningful procedural justice, allowing communities to participate on more equal footing.
        *   Introduce Open Source Appropriate Technology (OSAT) as the ultimate embodiment of this principle. Use the solar racking (Rana) and scientific equipment (Mottaghi) examples to show OSAT in action.
        *   Explicitly connect the benefits of OSAT (local adaptation, lower cost, user agency) back to the principles of distributive and procedural justice, showing a closed loop.

**4. Conclusion**
    *   **Synthesize:** Reiterate that the problem of energy injustice is a direct result of a closed model, and the solution must therefore be a systemic shift to an open one.
    *   **Concluding Thought:** End by stating that open science is not just about better research, but about reconfiguring power, transforming communities from passive stakeholders into active architects of a more just and sustainable energy future.
