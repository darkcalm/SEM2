### V6 Annotated Bibliography: Energy, Ethics, and Methodology

This bibliography provides a consolidated, annotated list of key sources that directly address the intersection of research methodologies, ethical dimensions, and specific case studies within the energy sector. It combines findings from new, targeted searches with the most relevant sources from previous project versions.

**1. Foundational Case Study**

**Vega-Araújo, J., & Heffron, R. J. (2022). *Assessing elements of energy justice in Colombia: A case study on transmission infrastructure in La Guajira*. Energy Research & Social Science, 91, 102688.**
-   **Methodology:** Qualitative case study, employing semi-structured interviews. Uses the "energy justice" framework (procedural, distributive, recognition) as its primary analytical lens.
-   **Contribution:** This is the cornerstone text for Version 6. It provides a direct, empirical link between a specific energy project (a high-voltage transmission line) and the three core tenets of justice. It details how procedural failures (e.g., lack of legitimate representation, information asymmetry) and distributive conflicts (e.g., disputes over compensation) are rooted in a failure of recognition justice—the dismissal of indigenous rights, culture, and social structures.
-   **Relevance:** This article provides the central, grounding case study for the paper, allowing the analysis to be firmly rooted in a specific energy context as required by the V6 mandate.

**2. Core Conceptual Framework**

**Sovacool, B. K., & Dworkin, M. H. (2015). *Energy justice: Conceptual insights and practical applications*.**
-   **Methodology:** Conceptual review and framework development.
-   **Contribution:** This foundational text defines the "triumvirate" of energy justice tenets: distributive, procedural, and recognition.
-   **Relevance:** Provides the theoretical backbone and core vocabulary for the paper's analytical framework.

**Jenkins, K., McCauley, D., & Heffron, R. (2016). *Energy justice: A conceptual review*. Energy Research & Social Science, 11, 174-182.**
-   **Methodology:** Comprehensive literature review and conceptual synthesis.
-   **Contribution:** Expands on the Sovacool & Dworkin framework and maps the concept of energy justice across various disciplines.
-   **Relevance:** Allows for a more nuanced discussion and helps frame the analysis within a wider scholarly conversation.

**3. Methodological and Ethical Analysis**

**Gross, C. (2007). *Community perspectives of wind energy in Australia: The application of a justice and community fairness framework to increase social acceptance*. Energy Policy, 35(5), 2727-2736.**
-   **Methodology:** Social survey and qualitative analysis of community feedback regarding wind farm developments.
-   **Contribution:** Demonstrates that procedural justice is a key determinant of social acceptance for renewable energy projects, arguing against simplistic "NIMBY" explanations.
-   **Relevance:** Provides a concrete example of how failures in procedural justice can derail an energy project. This case will be used to illustrate the ethical challenges of top-down assessment methodologies.

**Hyysalo, S., Pollock, N., & Williams, R. (2019). *Method Matters in the Social Study of Technology*. Science and Technology Studies, 32(3), 2-25.**
-   **Methodology:** Methodological review.
-   **Contribution:** Introduces the "biography of artifacts and practices" (BOAP) as a sophisticated qualitative method for longitudinal study.
-   **Relevance:** Provides an example of a specific, named methodology from the social studies of technology that can be mapped onto the ethical framework.

**Wieten, S. (2017). *Not Just About Consent: The Ethical Dimensions of Research Methodology Knowledge in IRBs*. BMJ Medical Ethics Blog.**
-   **Methodology:** Ethical commentary.
-   **Contribution:** Argues that methodologically poor science is inherently unethical, especially when it involves human participants.
-   **Relevance:** Supports the core argument that methodological choices are ethical choices. A flawed research design that produces no reliable knowledge while exposing participants to risk is an ethical failure in itself.
