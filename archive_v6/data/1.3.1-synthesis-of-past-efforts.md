### Synthesis of Past Efforts and Mandate for Version 6

This document summarizes the key findings from a review of all previous project versions (`archive/` through `archive_v5/`) and establishes the guiding mandate for Version 6.

#### 1. Key Successes from Past Versions

- **Shift to a Descriptive Framework (V5):** The most significant success was the move away from a normative, argumentative stance ("problem/solution") to a descriptive and analytical one. Version 5 successfully established a framework for mapping "methodological families" (Quantitative, Qualitative, Participatory) to their corresponding "ethical terrains" (Distributive, Procedural, Recognition Justice).
- **Introduction of Key Concepts (V5):** The framework from V5 introduced crucial analytical concepts like the distinction between "procedural ethics" and "ethics in practice," and the role of the "methodologist" in shaping research fields. This provides a strong conceptual foundation for the paper.

#### 2. Key Shortcomings Identified

- **Lack of Specificity (All Versions):** The primary failure across all previous versions was the lack of a consistent and deep grounding in the **energy sector**. The analysis of methodologies and ethics remained too general, using broad examples rather than specific case studies from energy research.
- **Overly Argumentative Tone (V1-V4):** The initial versions adopted a polemical tone, which is contrary to the PRD's requirement for a descriptive, observational analysis. While this was corrected in V5, it's a key lesson learned.

#### 3. Guiding Mandate for Version 6

Based on this review, the mandate for Version 6 is clear and precise:

**Apply the successful descriptive framework from Version 5 to the specific context of energy research.**

This requires moving beyond generalities and demonstrating every analytical point with concrete examples and case studies from the energy literature. The core task is to answer the question: "How does a given research methodology function, and what ethical dimensions does it bring to light, *specifically within the context of an energy-related problem?*"
