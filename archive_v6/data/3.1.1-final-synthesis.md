### Final Synthesis: A Descriptive Map of Methodology and Ethics in Energy Research

This document synthesizes the project's conceptual framework with findings from a targeted, energy-focused literature review. It provides the core analysis for the final paper, mapping research methodologies to their ethical dimensions using specific examples from the energy sector.

#### 1. The Core Framework: Energy Justice and Methodological Choice

The central argument, refined through multiple project versions, is that **methodological choices are ethical choices**. Different research methods are not neutral tools; they are frameworks that shape what can be known, who is recognized as a legitimate knower, and how costs and benefits are distributed.

To analyze this, we use the **energy justice** framework, focusing on its three core tenets (Sovacool & Dworkin, 2015; Jenkins et al., 2016):

-   **Distributive Justice:** The allocation of costs, benefits, and risks.
-   **Procedural Justice:** The fairness and inclusivity of decision-making processes.
-   **Recognition Justice:** The respect for and protection of the rights, identities, and cultures of different groups.

The guiding principle is that a flawed research methodology can itself be an ethical failure, especially if it exposes participants to risk for no reliable knowledge (Wieten, 2017).

#### 2. Mapping Methodologies to Ethics: Evidence from the Energy Sector

The following sections map different families of research methods to the ethical dimensions they bring to the forefront, using concrete examples from energy research.

##### a. Quantitative & Economic Methods (e.g., Cost-Benefit Analysis)

-   **Description:** These methods aim to produce objective, numerical representations to allow for standardized comparison and valuation, often used in assessing the viability of large-scale energy projects.
-   **Ethical Terrain:** The primary ethical orientation is towards **distributive justice**. CBAs, for example, are explicitly designed to quantify and allocate the costs and benefits of a project.
-   **Energy Case Study:** The push for large-scale renewable energy infrastructure, such as the Colectora transmission line project in La Guajira, Colombia, is often justified by national-level CBAs that prioritize climate goals and grid stability. However, as the case shows, this focus on a single, aggregated metric can obscure deep injustices. The CBA framework struggles to account for the non-monetary values of ancestral lands or the cultural impacts of infrastructure, leading to conflicts rooted in a failure of **recognition justice** (Vega-Araújo & Heffron, 2022). The "objective" valuation of the CBA thus becomes a site of ethical and political contestation.

##### b. Qualitative & Ethnographic Methods (e.g., Interviews, Case Studies)

-   **Description:** These methods seek to understand phenomena from the perspective of the actors involved, focusing on meaning, context, and lived experience.
-   **Ethical Terrain:** These methods are well-suited to exploring **recognition justice** and **procedural justice**. They provide a means to understand the diverse values, cultures, and perceptions of fairness that quantitative methods may overlook.
-   **Energy Case Study:** The Vega-Araújo & Heffron (2022) study is itself a prime example. By using semi-structured interviews (a qualitative method), the researchers were able to uncover the Wayúu community's perception that the consultation process was illegitimate. The research revealed a conflict between the government-recognized "Traditional Authorities" and the community-recognized "Ancestral Authorities." A purely quantitative survey of "community leaders" would have missed this crucial distinction, thereby perpetuating a procedural injustice. The qualitative methodology was essential for bringing the issue of **recognition justice** (i.e., who is a legitimate representative?) to the forefront.

##### c. Participatory Methods (e.g., Participatory Action Research)

-   **Description:** These methods actively involve research subjects as co-producers of knowledge, breaking down the traditional researcher/subject hierarchy.
-   **Ethical Terrain:** These methods are explicitly designed to embody **procedural justice** by making the process itself more inclusive and empowering.
-   **Energy Case Study:** Studies on the social acceptance of wind farms in Australia show that opposition is often driven by a perceived lack of procedural fairness (Gross, 2007). Top-down planning processes, even if they result in community benefit agreements (a distributive measure), are often rejected because they lack genuine participation. A participatory approach, where community members are involved in the siting and design process from the outset, directly addresses this by building trust and a sense of shared ownership. This demonstrates that for many energy projects, achieving **procedural justice** through participatory methods is a prerequisite for achieving distributive or social acceptance.
