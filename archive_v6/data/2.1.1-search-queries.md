### V6 Search Queries: Energy, Ethics, and Methodology

This document outlines the targeted search queries for the Version 6 literature review, designed to find sources that explicitly connect research methodologies, ethical considerations, and the energy sector.

#### Tier 1: Broad Queries (Connecting the Three Core Concepts)
- `("research ethics" OR "procedural justice" OR "distributive justice" OR "recognition justice") AND ("energy research" OR "energy studies" OR "energy transitions") AND ("research methodology" OR "research design")`
- `("case study" OR "ethnography" OR "cost-benefit analysis" OR "participatory action research") AND ("ethics" OR "justice") AND ("energy infrastructure" OR "renewable energy" OR "fossil fuels")`

#### Tier 2: Methodology-Specific Queries
- **Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA):**
  - `"cost-benefit analysis" AND "ethics" AND ("energy projects" OR "power plants" OR "grid modernization")`
  - `"social cost of carbon" AND "ethical considerations" AND "energy policy"`
- **Participatory Action Research (PAR):**
  - `"participatory action research" AND ("energy justice" OR "community energy" OR "energy sovereignty")`
  - `"co-production" AND "ethics" AND ("renewable energy deployment" OR "energy access")`
- **Ethnography / Qualitative:**
  - `"ethnography" AND ("energy communities" OR "fossil fuel extraction" OR "utility regulation") AND "ethics"`
  - `"qualitative research" AND "procedural justice" AND "energy infrastructure siting"`

#### Tier 3: Theme-Specific Queries
