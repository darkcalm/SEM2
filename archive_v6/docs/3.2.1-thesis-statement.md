### V6 Descriptive Thesis Statement

This paper provides a descriptive analysis of the relationship between research methodology and ethics in the energy sector. It demonstrates, through case studies like the La Guajira transmission line project, that research methods are not neutral tools but are themselves ethical frameworks. Specifically, it maps how quantitative, qualitative, and participatory approaches differentially shape and reveal considerations of distributive, procedural, and recognition justice, arguing that the choice of method is a foundational ethical choice in any energy research endeavor.
