**Title:** A Descriptive Map: How Research Methodology Shapes Ethics in Energy Research

**1. Introduction (Approx. 0.5 pages)**
    -   **Hook:** Start with the premise that research has a dual responsibility: to produce reliable knowledge and to do so ethically. In the energy sector, where projects have immense social and environmental impact, this is paramount.
    -   **Thesis Statement:** Introduce the paper's core argument: methodological choices are not neutral; they are ethical frameworks that determine which aspects of justice (distributive, procedural, recognition) are brought into focus.
    -   **Framework Introduction:** Briefly define the three tenets of energy justice (Distributive, Procedural, Recognition) as the analytical lens for the paper.
    -   **Roadmap:** State that the paper will map three major families of research methods to these ethical dimensions, using specific case studies from energy research to illustrate the connections.

**2. Mapping Methodologies and Ethical Terrains (Approx. 1 page)**
    -   **a. Quantitative Methods and Distributive Justice:**
        -   **Topic Sentence:** Quantitative methods, like Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA), are primarily oriented towards questions of *distributive justice* by calculating and allocating costs and benefits.
        -   **Case Study:** Discuss the use of CBAs in justifying large-scale projects like the La Guajira transmission line.
        -   **Analysis:** Explain how this methodological focus on a single economic metric, while useful for national-level planning, can obscure the *recognition justice* claims of local communities by failing to value cultural and ancestral lands (Vega-Araújo & Heffron, 2022).
    -   **b. Qualitative Methods and Recognition Justice:**
        -   **Topic Sentence:** In contrast, qualitative methods, such as semi-structured interviews and ethnographic case studies, are uniquely suited to exploring the terrain of *recognition justice*.
        -   **Case Study:** Use the Vega-Araújo & Heffron (2022) study itself as the example.
        -   **Analysis:** Show how their qualitative approach was able to identify the conflict between state-recognized and community-recognized leaders—a critical issue of legitimacy and recognition that a quantitative survey would have missed. This reveals how the choice of method determines whether such crucial social nuances are "seen" by the research.
    -   **c. Participatory Methods and Procedural Justice:**
        -   **Topic Sentence:** Participatory methods are designed to explicitly embody *procedural justice* by embedding inclusion and fairness into the research process itself.
        -   **Case Study:** Use the example of Australian wind farm developments (Gross, 2007).
        -   **Analysis:** Argue that community opposition was driven by a lack of procedural fairness, not just a rejection of the infrastructure. A participatory methodology, by giving the community a voice in the process, directly addresses this ethical dimension and is often a prerequisite for social acceptance, regardless of the distributive outcome.

**3. Conclusion (Approx. 0.5 pages)**
    -   **Synthesize Findings:** Briefly summarize the three-part mapping, reiterating that each methodological family brings a different ethical landscape into focus.
    -   **Restate Thesis:** Conclude that the choice between a CBA, an ethnographic study, or a participatory workshop is not merely a technical decision but a foundational ethical one. It determines what is valued, who is heard, and how justice is defined.
    -   **Final Thought:** End by stating that for energy research to be truly responsible, researchers must be as deliberate in their choice of methodology as they are in their analysis of data.
